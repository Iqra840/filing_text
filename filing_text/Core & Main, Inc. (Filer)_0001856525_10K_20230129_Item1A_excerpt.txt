Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business 

You should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are important to understanding the contents of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and of other reports. Should one or more of these risks be realized, it could result in a material impact to our operations, liquidity or financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones relevant to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

We have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by declines and volatility in the U.S. residential and non-residential construction markets, which may result in reduced net sales. 

Our business is largely dependent on activity in the U.S. residential and non-residential construction markets, which are volatile and subject to cyclical market pressures. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by market. Approximately 22% and 39% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 were directly related to the U.S. residential and non-residential end markets, respectively. The level of activity in the U.S. residential and non-residential construction markets is based on numerous factors such as availability of credit, interest rates, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and other factors that are beyond our control. For example, interest rate increases throughout calendar 2022 and into 2023 are a contributing factor to slowing new lot development and contraction in the residential end market. It is uncertain if the Federal Reserve Board will continue to raise rates in the future and if so to what level and for how long. Continued rate increases may result in a downturn in U.S. residential and non-residential construction markets that could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We cannot predict the duration of the residential or non-residential construction industry market conditions or the timing of the recovery of residential or non-residential construction activity back to the historical averages. Participants in the U.S. residential and non-residential construction industries may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products. We also cannot provide any assurances that the operational strategies we have implemented to address current or future market conditions will be successful. Due to these factors and the potential volatility in the residential and non-residential construction markets, there may be fluctuations in our operating results, and the results for any historical period may not be indicative of results for any future period. This uncertainty about current or future economic conditions and potential volatility in U.S. residential and non-residential construction markets may lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Our business and the market for our products and services generally are subject to slowdowns in municipal infrastructure spending which may result in reduced net sales. 

The market for the distribution of our products and services is affected by national, regional and local slowdowns in the amount spent by municipalities on infrastructure. We supply many of our products to contractors in connection with municipal projects. Approximately 39% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 were related to the municipal market. Many of the factors that influence municipal infrastructure spending are not within our control.

Municipal infrastructure spending depends largely on availability and commitment of public funds for municipal spending, interest rates, water system capacity and general economic conditions. Economic downturns in any of our markets could reduce municipal tax revenues and the level of infrastructure spending and construction activity and thus our net sales. 

In addition, municipal budget processes and conditions in the municipal bond market can impact municipal spending. If a municipality is experiencing budget difficulties, or if a municipality is unable to access capital through the municipal bond market or state revolving funds, it may allocate less funding to infrastructure projects, which could also adversely affect our net sales.

Fluctuations in federal funding can also negatively impact municipal spending. Reduced federal funding and corresponding reductions in federal fund appropriations can adversely affect many of our customers, who derive funding from federal, state and local bodies, which in turn can reduce the demand for our products and services. Conversely, increased federal funding can also adversely affect our business by slowing down state and local spending as a result of delays in appropriating such federal funding to our end customers. In November 2021, the IIJA, which includes $55 billion to invest in water infrastructure across the U.S., was signed into law. When such a large amount of federal funding for infrastructure projects is allocated at once, funds may not be efficiently distributed to the markets in which we operate on a timely basis. Many of our customers, including those in our municipal end market, may also choose or be forced to delay the commencement of infrastructure projects until such funds are allocated, may choose or be forced to re-scope construction-ready infrastructure projects to qualify for federal funding or may not be able to timely pay for products or services provided, which could delay any benefits we expect to receive from the IIJA. In conjunction with the IIJA, the Build America Buy America Act (“BABA”) was enacted, which requires that all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in covered infrastructure projects are produced in the U.S. Should the products we distribute be deemed to not comply with BABA, we may not realize the potential benefits from the IIJA. Further, while our industries may benefit from increased federal funding, there is no certainty that we will receive benefits associated with such increase, as a disproportionate amount of funds could go to our competitors.

We may lose business to competitors through the competitive bidding process. 

A portion of municipal infrastructure work is awarded through competitive bidding processes in which municipalities or contractors serving municipalities compare estimates from multiple distributors. In addition, certain contractors that serve residential and non-residential markets obtain estimates from multiple distributors. The procurement process for this work is based in part on price and the acceptance of certain risks, including risks related to fixed-price contracts and cost-overruns. We may lose business to lower-cost competitors from price-sensitive customers who do not value our sales reach, technical knowledge, broad product portfolio, customer service and project planning and delivery capabilities. In addition, increased competition from other market participants may cause us, or our contractor clients bidding for such contracts, to not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts. Our inability to replace a significant number of contracts lost through competitive bidding processes with other revenue sources within a reasonable time could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

We are subject to price fluctuations in our product costs.

The costs to procure the products we sell are historically volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and international economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade policies, supply chain constraints, as well as delivery delays due to the availability of domestic or global logistics, and fuel cost volatility.

Our financial performance is impacted by price fluctuations in the cost to procure substantially all the products we sell and our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing. Increases in prices of products we purchase and sell has increased over the past twenty-four months due to several factors, including, but not limited to, constraints in the supply chain associated with labor, global logistics, and availability of raw materials, that are in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, conflict in countries that export raw materials in our products and other weather events. These factors led to decreased availability of certain products that we purchase from our suppliers. Disruptions caused by natural disasters or similar extreme weather events may also affect our ability to both maintain key products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect the Company. For example, operations at certain plants and facilities located in Texas that produce resin, a raw material used in the production of the PVC pipe that we purchase from suppliers, were temporarily shut down as a result of the winter storms of 2021, which caused supply chain disruptions and PVC pipe shortages, which in turn drove product cost increases. Any material shortage of products in the market as a result of natural disasters or similar extreme weather events can negatively impact our net sales, and we may not be able to offset increased product costs via corresponding price increases. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine resulted in increases in costs associated with products containing ductile iron and steel. A shortage of available manufacturing capacity, or excess capacity, in the industry can result in significant increases or declines in the supply of our products, which in turn results in fluctuations in the market prices for our products, sometimes within a short period of time. Although in some cases we have firm price quotes with our suppliers that fix the price at which we purchase products for a defined period of time, we have experienced termination of certain contracts through the enactment of force majeure contractual clauses.

We may experience price volatility associated with the implementation or rescission of tariffs or other restrictions placed on foreign imports by the U.S. or any related counter-measures are taken by impacted foreign countries. Tariff-related activities may also impact the level of demand associated with products subject to tariffs as our customers may seek alternative products. Most recently, the U.S. enacted tariffs on imported steel products from China that led domestic sellers to respond with market-based increases. It remains unclear what future actions may be taken by the U.S. or other governments with respect to international trade agreements, the imposition or removal of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., the creation or removal of barriers to trade, tax policy related to international commerce, or other trade matters, and the impact of those actions of the cost of products we sell. 

We have a limited ability to control the timing and amount of changes in the cost to procure our products. Although we seek to recover increases in our product costs by passing product cost increases on to our customers, we may not always be successful. In addition, in periods of declining costs for our products, we may face pricing pressure from our customers, requiring us to reduce the prices at which we sell our products to our customers in order to remain competitive in our markets. As we have experienced significant product cost increases over the past twenty-four months, there is increased risk in future periods that we may experience a higher level of deflation, net sales declines or net sales growth at substantially lower rates than in recent periods following improvements in the availability of labor, transportation and products. Due to supply chain constraints, distributors may have increased inventory levels to ensure product availability. As the supply chain improves and product lead time becomes more predictable, distributors may reduce their inventory levels. This may increase competition by suppliers based on price and contribute to deflation. We estimate that approximately 100 to 150 basis points of the fiscal 2022 gross margin increases could be temporary in nature and may not be sustainable once product supply dynamics return to normal and market pricing stabilizes. Our ability to adjust prices in a timely manner to account for such price fluctuations may often depend on market conditions, our fixed costs and other factors, and our failure to adapt our product prices and operational strategies could result in lower revenue, profitability and the write down of our inventories. Historically, we have not engaged in material hedging strategies for purchases of products. We generally sell our products on a spot basis and not under long-term contracts. Any increase in product costs that are not offset by an increase in our prices, or our inability to maintain price levels in an environment of declining product costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We are subject to inventory management risks. Insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may negatively impact our gross margin. 

We balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing customer or consumer requirements and fluctuating product costs. If we overestimate demand and purchase too much of a particular product, we face a risk that the price of that product will fall, leaving us with inventory that we cannot sell at historical profit margins or record a material charge if we are required to write-down inventory at net realizable value. Even after an inventory write-down we would likely not be able to sell the inventory at historical product margins. If we underestimate demand and purchase insufficient quantities of products, inventory shortages could result in delayed revenue, loss of sales opportunities, and/or reduced profit margins. Either of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. These risks are elevated during periods of supply chain disruption as we may simultaneously be unable to obtain certain products in a timely manner and increase on-hand quantities of other products.

Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve a number of inherent risks, any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized.

Acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy and we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in net sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions as we have done historically or that any businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. Our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transactions that we complete is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, supply chain and logistics, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management and other critical personnel; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses and other strategic transactions with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing product offerings. Moreover, consolidation in our industry could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins and could also increase competition for our potential acquisition targets and result in higher purchase price multiples. 

In addition, our expansion into new markets and product categories through acquisition may present competitive, distribution and regulatory challenges that differ from current ones. We may be less familiar with the target customers and may face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to existing operations. Growth into new markets may also bring us into direct competition with companies with whom we have little or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we are reliant upon expansion into new geographic, industry and product markets for growth and do not meet the new challenges posed by such expansion our ability for future sales growth may be limited and/or we may incur higher operating costs. 

In connection with any acquisition, we may acquire liabilities or defects such as legal claims, including those not identified during due diligence, such as third-party liability and other tort claims; claims for breach of contract; employment-related claims; environmental, health and safety liabilities, conditions or damage; permitting, regulatory or other compliance with law issues; liability for hazardous materials; or trade liabilities. If we acquire any of these liabilities, and they are not adequately covered by insurance or an enforceable indemnity or similar agreement from a creditworthy counterparty, we may be responsible for significant out-of-pocket expenditures. In connection with any divestitures, we may incur liabilities for breaches of representations and warranties or failure to comply with operating covenants under any agreement for a divestiture. In addition, we may indemnify a counterparty in a divestiture for certain liabilities of the subsidiary or operations subject to the divestiture transaction. These liabilities, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

In addition, any future acquisition could be financed by additional indebtedness or raising equity, which could increase leverage or result in dilution to our existing stockholders, as applicable, and impact our ability to access capital in the future. See “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness.” 

Our industry and the markets in which we operate are fragmented and highly competitive, and increased competitive pressures, including the pressure to consolidate, could adversely affect our business.

The markets in which we operate are fragmented and highly competitive. Competition varies depending on product line, type of customer and geographic area. We have only one major national competitor, but we also face competition from regional and local competitors and a limited number of manufacturers who sell directly to large customers within our customer base. We estimate that our net sales accounted for approximately 17% of our $40 billion addressable market in fiscal 2022. Any failure to compete with our national, regional or local competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

There has also been some consolidation of customers within our industry who are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. This consolidation could cause our industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by customers, or as competitors with new lower cost transactional business models are able to operate with lower prices. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer distributors as the remaining distributors become larger and more capable of being consistent sources of supply. If customers grow from consolidation, they may choose to vertically integrate the distribution of products we sell and purchase directly from our vendors. This level of direct procurement would bypass distributors, including us, and could have a material adverse impact to our sales and/or make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins.

The development of alternatives to distributors of our products in the supply chain could cause a decrease in our net sales and operating results and limit our ability to grow our business. 

Our customers could begin purchasing more of their product needs directly from our suppliers, which could result in decreases in our net sales and earnings. For example, multiple municipalities may outsource their entire waterworks systems to a single company, thereby increasing such company’s leverage in the marketplace and its ability to buy directly from suppliers. Our suppliers could also invest in increasing their capacity to expand their own local sales force and sell more products directly to our customers, which could result in a decrease in our net sales. Suppliers can often sell their products at lower prices and maintain higher gross margins on their product sales than we can. We intend to compete for these larger municipal projects, but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to complete any such projects within the anticipated budget or timeline. 

As we continue to expand our direct sourcing and distribution capabilities as part of the private label initiative, this could result in loss of preferred access to products and unfavorable adjustments to pricing and terms due to direct competition with suppliers.

We may be unable to hire, engage and retain key personnel, including sales representatives, qualified branch, district and regional managers and senior management.

We are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to hire, engage and retain key associates, including sales representatives, qualified branch, district and regional managers and senior management, at our operations across the U.S. We rely upon experienced managerial, sales and support personnel to effectively manage our business and to successfully promote our wide range of products. We are primarily organized locally in branches and districts to allow our operations to respond to changes in local markets. As a result, our branch and district managers have a great deal of control over local operations. We also rely upon our national and regional teams of technical experts to provide insights on complex projects. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified branch and district managers or technical experts, we could be unable to respond to changes in local markets or developments in our projects in a timely manner, or at all.

Additionally, our operations depend on the continued efforts of our senior management. Our senior management team has substantial experience and expertise in our industry and has made significant contributions to our growth and success. The loss of their services could limit our ability to grow our business and cause disruptions in our operations. 

If we fail to identify, develop and maintain relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers or our exclusive or restrictive supplier distribution rights are terminated, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our standards for quality could be adversely affected or we may experience an increase in the costs of our products that could reduce our overall profitability. 

We buy our products and supplies from suppliers that manufacture and source products from the United States and abroad. We enter into agreements with many of our suppliers that provide us with exclusive or restrictive distribution rights, limiting our competitors’ ability to source materials from such suppliers. Our ability to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers and enter into exclusive or restrictive distribution rights agreements with suppliers who can satisfy our standards for quality and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. In fiscal 2022, our top supplier accounted for approximately 8% of our product expenditures. Our top ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 47% of our total purchases in fiscal 2022. We generally have multiple sources of supply, however, in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. Any failure to maintain our relationship with any of our top ten largest suppliers, the loss of a sole source supplier, or a failure to replace any such supplier that is lost, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

We may be required to replace a supplier if their products do not meet our quality or safety standards. In addition, our suppliers could discontinue selling products at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the suppliers’ control, including shortages of raw materials, environmental and social supply chain issues, labor disputes or weather conditions. Disruptions in transportation lines, such as the March 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal and the adverse impact to the global shipping industry, may also cause global supply chain issues that affect us or our suppliers. Global economic conditions may also result in global supply chain issues that adversely impact our access to products and supplies.

Our operating results are sensitive to the availability of freight. 

We are dependent on third-party freight carriers to transport some of our products. Our access to third-party freight carriers is not guaranteed, and we may be unable to transport our products at economically attractive rates in certain circumstances, particularly in cases of adverse market conditions or disruptions to transportation infrastructure. For example, the U.S. is currently experiencing a shortage of qualified professional commercial truck drivers, which has impacted our suppliers’ ability to deliver products to us and our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. There can be no certainty that such shortage will be addressed in the near term and we may be unable to secure alternative means of freight transport. If the freight carrier capacity in our geographic markets were to decline significantly it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

A significant amount of our net sales are credit sales, which are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry and geographic areas in which they operate. 

Approximately 98% of our net sales volume in fiscal 2022 was facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry in the areas in which they operate. In some cases, our extension of credit is secured by mechanic liens or surety bonds backed by a surety company, but such security does not guarantee collection. If a customer is unable to pay off our mechanic lien or if such lien is not superior to other lienholders and creditors, we may not be able to recoup our extension of credit. The credit we extend to a customer depends on both the financial strength of the customer and the nature of the project in which the customer is involved. Certain customers may not make payments to us until they receive payments from their own customers. Supply chain constraints may extend project completion dates and ultimately the time until we receive full payment from our customers. The inability of our customers to pay off their credit lines in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Furthermore, our collections efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers could negatively impact our customer relations going forward. In addition, if our collections process fails to collect money due from a customer, we may be forced to initiate litigation against such customer to compel payment. Any such litigation could be costly, and the outcome would be uncertain. 

Because we depend on the creditworthiness of certain of our customers, if the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risk could increase. Significant contraction in our markets, coupled with tightened credit availability and financial institution credit underwriting standards, could adversely affect certain of our customers. If we experience delays and defaults in client payments and we pay our suppliers before receiving payment from our customers for the related products or services, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

A change in supplier terms could adversely affect our income and margins. 

The terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers entitle us to receive a rebate based on the amount of our purchases, a discount for timely payment or other favorable terms reflected in our historical results. These rebates effectively reduce the costs of our products, and we manage our business to maximize the benefit of these programs. Rebate arrangements are subject to renegotiation with our suppliers from time to time. Suppliers may adversely change the terms of or eliminate some or all of these programs. Although these changes would not affect the net recorded costs of products already purchased, they may materially lower our gross margins on products we sell or income we realize in future periods.

The rebate programs we negotiate with our vendors often require us to purchase minimum quantities or dollar amount of purchases to qualify for the rebate and result in higher rebates with increased quantities or dollars purchased. Even if our rebate programs are not adversely effected through negotiation, we may not earn rebates at level commensurate with historical periods and our gross margin percentage may be adversely impacted. Changes to our end markets that decrease demand for products or planned inventory reductions due to more reliable lead times for products may cause us to fall short of minimum quantities or dollar amounts required to earn a rebate or preclude us from reaching the highest rebates offered by our vendors. As many rebate programs are calculated as a percentage of dollars spent, deflation in product costs can adversely impact rebates earned relative to historical periods.

We may not be able to identify new products and new product lines and integrate them into our distribution network, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. 

Our business depends in part on our ability to identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs, as well as our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, as well as customer wants, preferences and expectations. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete, including the need for more localized assortments of our products to appeal to needs in each end-market, or trends in new products. As a result, we continually seek to offer products and solutions that allow us to stay at the forefront of the needs of the market for our products and services. The success of new products depends on a variety of factors, including timely and successful product development by our suppliers, market acceptance and demand, competitive response, our ability to manage risks associated with product life cycles, the effective management of inventory and purchase commitments and the availability and cost of raw materials for our suppliers. Some of the foregoing factors are beyond our control and we cannot fully predict the ultimate success of the introduction of new products. For example, water utilities have traditionally been slow adopters of new technology and may not adopt our new products as quickly as we expect. In introducing new products and solutions, any delays, unexpected costs, diversion of resources, loss of key associates, failure of the market to accept the new product or other setbacks could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.

A public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

A public health crisis and associated government restrictions to prevent its spread could have, an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition as well as the operations of some of our suppliers. A widespread public health crisis may decrease demand for our products due to public reaction to the health crisis or actions taken by governmental or other regulatory organizations to control or otherwise limit the effects of the public health crisis. This crisis may also limit labor availability that could adversely impact manufacturing and distribution throughout the supply chain and limit the availability of product by our suppliers. Depending on the ultimate scope and duration of the supply chain disruptions, we may experience increases in product costs which we may not be able to pass on to our customers, loss of sales due to lack of product availability or potential customer claims from the inability to provide products in accordance with contractual terms. In addition, if significant numbers of associates, key personnel and/or senior management become unavailable due to sickness, legal requirements or self-isolation, our operations could be disrupted and materially adversely affected. Measures taken in response to a public health crisis could adversely impact our ability to retain and attract associates, including key personnel.

The effects of a public health crisis were evident in the COVID-19 pandemic that we experienced in fiscal 2020, with continuing effects through fiscal 2021 and 2022. In fiscal 2020, we experienced decreased demand for our products and softening in our business, primarily during the second and third fiscal quarters. As our industry was considered to be an “essential service,” customer demand returned to normal levels in late fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. However, we then experienced increased pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, labor availability, global logistics and availability of raw materials, that were in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy that led to significant inflation in late fiscal 2021 and throughout fiscal 2022.

We are unable to predict the likelihood, timing, magnitude and duration of a public health crisis and the associated effects to our business; but a future occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We could incur significant costs in complying with environmental, health and safety laws or permitting regimes or as a result of satisfying any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or permitting regimes. 

Our facilities and operations are subject to a broad range of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including those relating to the release of hazardous materials into the environment, the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination and the protection of our associates. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital expenditures in addition to ordinary course costs to comply with applicable current and future environmental, health and safety laws. More stringent federal, state or local environmental rules or regulations could increase our operating costs and expenses. Our failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws may result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions and other sanctions as well as liability for response costs, property damages and personal injuries resulting from releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. We could also be held liable for the costs to address contamination at any real property we have ever owned or operated, or used as a storage or disposal site. In addition, changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental, health or safety liabilities or obligations in the future, including additional investigation or other obligations with respect to any potential health hazards of our products or business activities, may lead to additional compliance or other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

17

We cannot assure you that any costs relating to future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, as well as costs to address contamination or environmental claims, will not exceed any current estimates and reserves or adversely affect our business. In addition, any unanticipated liabilities or obligations arising, for example, out of the discovery of previously unknown conditions or changes in law or enforcement policies, could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.

We are subject to regulation and regulatory change, and our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. 

Our operations are principally affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in the U.S. states in which we operate. While we are not engaged in a heavily regulated industry, we are subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage, zoning, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices, competition, immigration and other matters. Additionally, building codes may affect the products our customers are allowed to use, and consequently, changes in building codes may affect the saleability of our products. In addition, changes to U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations could have a material impact on us. See Item 1. “Business—Regulation.”

We deliver products to many of our customers through our own fleet of vehicles. The U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to various requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT, including safety regulations and other rules, including, for example, the DOT Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) Program, which imposes certain requirements to increase DBE participation in DOT-assisted projects and contracts. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size and trailer length and configuration could increase our costs. Furthermore, commercial driver’s licensing requirements imposed by states or local governments could limit the availability of qualified drivers to transport our products, which could also increase our costs. If we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, it would reduce our gross margins, increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and reduce our net income.

In addition, many of our municipal water products and infrastructure customers are regulated by federal and state government agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state public utility commissions. These agencies could change the way in which they interpret current regulations and may impose additional regulations. Further, there may also be new legislation or regulatory change in response to the perceived effects of climate change, which is expected to continue to be the subject of increasing regulatory attention and requirements. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs that could increase our environmental compliance expenditures. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our customers and the profitability of the services they provide, which could reduce demand for our services or our products and could further subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy, compliance and product costs.

We cannot predict the nature and timing of future developments in law and regulations and whether we will be successful in meeting future demands of regulatory agencies in a manner which will not materially adversely affect the Company. 

Increasing scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations and disclosures in respect of ESG and sustainability practices may adversely impact our business and our stock price and impose additional costs or expose us to new or additional risks.

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG and sustainability practices. Investor advocacy groups, proxy advisory firms, certain institutional investors and lenders, investment funds and other influential investors and rating agencies are also increasingly focused on ESG and sustainability practices and matters and on the implications and social cost of their investments and loans. Increased focus on ESG and sustainability matters could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, and expose us to new or additional risks, including as described below.

18

* * *

  


We recognize that our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, regulators and other stakeholders expect us to continue to focus on long-term sustainable performance and the broad positive impact we can have on the environment and in our communities. This includes addressing significant, relevant ESG factors, further working to prioritize sustainable energy practices and reducing our carbon footprint. We must also make strategic investments to ensure our sustainability goals and objectives are responsive to the broader market environment and directly tied to our overarching business priorities. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs and capital expenditures in doing so, and certain of such future costs and capital expenditures could be material. For example, on March 21, 2022, the SEC released proposed rule changes that would require new climate-related disclosure in SEC filings, including certain climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions, information about climate-related targets and goals, transition plans, if any, and extensive attestation requirements. In addition to requiring filers to quantify and disclose direct emissions data, the new rules would also require disclosure of climate impact arising from the operations and uses by the filer's business partners and contractors and end-users of the filer's products and/or services. If adopted as proposed, the rule changes would cause us to incur additional compliance and reporting costs, certain of which could be material, including related to monitoring, collecting, analyzing and reporting new metrics and implementing systems and procuring additional internal and external personnel with the requisite skills and expertise to serve those functions and provide necessary attestation, as applicable. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Further, if we do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived not to have responded appropriately or quickly enough to growing concern for ESG and sustainability issues, our business could suffer, including from reputational damage. Additionally, activist shareholders may submit proposals to promote an ESG-related position. Responding to such proposals, proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations, causing reputational harm, and diverting the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. Further, a multitude of organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG and sustainability matters. Such ratings and reports are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or perceptions of us or our industry as a result of such ratings or our ESG and sustainability practices, may lead to increased negative investor and other stakeholder sentiment toward us or our customers, and to the allocation of investment capital to other industries and companies, which could negatively affect our stock price and access to and costs of capital.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

The nature of our business exposes us to product liability, construction defect and warranty claims and other litigation and legal proceedings. 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings and claims (including government inquiries, investigations and proceedings) in the ordinary course of business related to a range of matters, including, without limitation, environmental, contract, employment claims, product liability, construction defect and warranty claims.

We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with most of the products we sell and distribute. However, as a distributor, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage or violated environmental, health or safety or other laws. In addition, we fabricate and install certain products, either internally or through third parties, which may increase our exposure to product liability claims. We cannot predict with certainty whether or how we may become liable under environmental and product liability statutes, rules, regulations and case law. In particular, we have been and continue to be subject to claims related to asbestos containing products, including for claims relating to products sold by businesses prior to being acquired by us. Asbestos-related claims have not historically had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations, but there can be no guarantee that any such claims will not have a material impact on us in the future. Although we currently maintain product/general liability insurance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Additionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter (including asbestos claims for which insurance is not attainable). Any significant liability that is uninsured or not fully insured may require us to pay substantial amounts. See additional discussion in Item 1. “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

We also may, from time to time, be involved in government inquiries, investigations and proceedings. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these inquiries, investigations and proceedings. The outcome of some of these events and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition, such as requiring us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters.

Further, while we may seek indemnification against potential liability for product liability claims from relevant parties, including, but not limited to, manufacturers and suppliers, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recover under such indemnification claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant time periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could be highly costly and accordingly result in a decline in net sales and/or profitability. In addition, even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute, claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and us.

Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product quality as a result of our suppliers’ or manufacturers’ mistakes or inefficiencies could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenue and results of operations. 

To continue to be successful, we must continue to preserve, grow and capitalize on the value of our brand in the marketplace. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, such as a high-profile product recall, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if such incident or incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish our brand and lead to a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

In particular, product quality issues as a result of our suppliers’ or manufacturers’ acts or omissions could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our products. As we do not have direct control over the quality of the products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of the products we distribute. If our product offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality, or are alleged to have quality issues or to have caused personal injury or other damage, we could experience lower revenue and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. In addition, actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could result in costly product recalls. 

We seek to enter into contracts with suppliers which provide for indemnification from any costs associated with the provision of defective products. However, there can be no assurance that such contractual rights will be obtained or adequate, or that related indemnification claims will be successfully asserted by us. 

Any difficulties with, or interruptions of, our fabrication services could delay our output of products and harm our relationships with our customers.

Any difficulties with, or interruptions of, our fabrication service operations could delay our output of products and harm our relationships with our customers. Although the majority of our overall product offerings relate to distribution for which we engage in no significant manufacturing, we do perform light fabrication services for certain product categories, including fire protection, storm drainage and fusible piping products, which collectively accounted for less than 5% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and which we believe are products with significant opportunities for growth. If our fabrication processes fail, we may fail to perform on our contracts with our customers unless we are able to obtain comparable products or services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, the performance of fabrication services on the products we sell may increase our exposure to product defect liabilities for which we have no recovery of losses through vendor indemnification. If we are unable to fabricate certain products, find suitable replacements for them or experience product defect liabilities it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

We are subject to certain safety and labor risks associated with the distribution and fabrication of our products. 

As of January 29, 2023, we employed approximately 4,500 associates in total, a significant percentage of whom work at our branch locations. Our business involves transporting industrial water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and operating heavy machinery such as forklifts and tractor trailers, and there is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles and therefore face the risk of traffic accidents. The outcome of any personal injury, wrongful death or other litigation is difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend litigation can be significant. Although we currently maintain insurance, including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation, automobile and general liability, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. As a result, the costs to defend any action or the potential liability resulting from any such accident or death or arising out of any other litigation, and any negative publicity associated therewith or negative effects on associate morale, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We provide medical coverage to some of our associates through a self-insured preferred provider organization. Though we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage in excess of self-insured retention levels, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected if the number and severity of insurance claims increases.

An impairment of goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible or long-lived assets. As of January 29, 2023, goodwill and amortizing intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, represented 31% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to impairment testing at least annually using a fair value-based approach. Future events, such as declines in our cash flow projections or customer demand, may cause impairments of our goodwill or long-lived assets, including intangible assets, based on factors such as the price of our common stock, projected cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables. In addition, if we divest long-lived assets at prices below their asset value, we must write them down to fair value resulting in long-lived asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets, and, in the future, we may be required to take additional goodwill or other asset impairment charges. Any such non-cash charges could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

Interruptions in the proper functioning of our and our third-party service providers’ information technology (“IT”) systems or compromise of our or our customers’ confidential data, including from cybersecurity threats, could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated reputational harm, litigation and regulatory risk, as well as increases in costs or decreases in net sales, or both. 

Because we use our information systems, including Smart Distributor, PowerScope, Online Advantage, Mobile Advantage and other platforms to, among other things, manage inventories and accounts receivable, make purchasing decisions, prepare project bids, assist our customers and improve our customers’ experience and monitor our results of operations, the proper functioning of our IT systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Our IT systems, confidential data, as well as our remote processing capabilities and physical and software safeguards or those of our suppliers and customers, may be vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, cyber attacks, theft, or unauthorized access (including through any intentional or malicious attacks, whether by a virus, malware or an outsider seeking to compromise our IT systems, or by a rogue associate), telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical IT systems fail, or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses and otherwise manage our business would be materially and adversely affected. 

Information security and cyber risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve and presents novel risks and we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers (or their downstream service providers), as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches has in the past, and could in the future, disrupt our business. For example, during fiscal 2020 a third-party payment processor with which we work experienced a ransomware attack that prevented them from processing check-based payments for us for a period of several weeks. In addition, a cyber-attack or information security breach could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, result in legal liability and regulatory action, damage our business relationships and reputation, result in or increase our litigation, remediation, forensic or other costs or cause losses. We may also incur significant administrative and technology costs in implementing and maintaining data security measures to prevent or limit the impact of such incidents. Damage to us or to our suppliers or customers resulting from such incidents could subject us to liability under U.S. state and federal and foreign laws that require us to implement certain data security protocols and to protect confidential personal data, which could result in increased costs, loss of revenues, settlement costs and/or substantial penalties that may either not be insured or not be fully covered through insurance. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access are and will continue to be a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we continually assess cyber risks, enhance our information security procedures and other safeguards, and implement updates to our IT systems. There can be no guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur and that our business or financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident. 

Our customer relationships are generally governed by purchase orders and job-specific customer agreements, as applicable, and not by long-term agreements, and, as a result, such customers have the right to change the terms under which they do business and/or terminate their relationship with us. 

Our customer relationships are governed by purchase orders and job-specific customer agreements, as applicable, and not by long-term agreements. Consequently, despite the length of our relationships with our customers and our low historical customer turnover rates, there can be no assurance that our customer base will remain stable in the future. If our customers do not renew orders, our business or financial condition could be negatively affected. 

21

* * *

  


While a portion of our net sales are made to customers with whom we have contractual relationships, many of these contracts are requirements contracts under which we supply a percentage of a customer’s requirements over a period of time, without any specific commitment by the customer to purchase a particular unit volume. As such, we are not guaranteed any minimum level of net sales under many of our contracts and many of our customers, including some of our largest customers, are under no obligation to continue to purchase products from us. 

Moreover, if a customer’s requirements for our products exceed our ability to supply that customer, as has occurred from time to time, we may have a short-term or long-term inability to supply that customer from our own branches and may be required to take other proactive steps in order to fill that customer’s order, which may be at a higher cost to us. Our inability to supply a customer’s specific requirements from our branches could materially and adversely affect our relationship with that customer or increase our operating costs. 

Most of our net sales are made to customers that do not have contracts in place and are not contractually obligated to purchase products from us. Our repeat business with respect to these customers largely depends on these customers’ satisfaction with our products and our customer service. At any time these customers can stop purchasing our products from us and cease doing business with us. We cannot be sure that any particular customer will continue to do business with us for any period of time. 

We are subject to risks associated with operating internationally. 

We export and import certain of our products to different jurisdictions outside the U.S., and the shipment of goods across international borders is subject to extensive trade laws and regulations. The laws and regulations concerning export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, export control, interactions with government officials and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing, and we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these or other regulatory requirements.

In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our activities in any country in which we deal with governmental clients create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our associates or contractors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. If we were to fail to comply with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws, applicable import-export control regulations, data privacy laws or other applicable rules and regulations, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties and the possible loss of export or import privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Any deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock. 

As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with this annual report we are required to provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. Our internal resources and personnel may in the future be insufficient to avoid accounting errors, and we and our auditors may identify deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control environment in the future.

Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered implementing required new or improved controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.

22

* * *

  


If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated or could result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. Moreover, because we regularly consider and enter into strategic mergers and acquisitions, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Such integration into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. 

If there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. If we have deficiencies in our internal controls, it may negatively impact our business or financial condition and reputation. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE or could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business. 

The impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis may impact depositors’ access to their cash deposits at financial institutions and create disruption in capital and credit markets. For example, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank created temporary uncertainty on their customers’ cash deposits in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits prior to actions taken by governmental entities. We have no direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank or Signature Bank. We maintain our cash deposits according to a banking policy that requires diversification across a variety of highly rated financial institutions. Our Senior ABL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) is also diversified across various financial institutions, with no individual bank making up more than 10 percent of our available credit line. However, there is no guarantee that other financial institutions won’t experience similar liquidity issues or that actions taken by governmental entities to mitigate these risks will be sufficient to ensure access to our cash deposits and sources of liquidity. As a result, a failure of one or more financial institutions with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

A liquidity crisis may also result in additional disruption that is not immediately evident but which results in, for example, negative impact on the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us in a timely basis or at all, reductions in the liquidity of our vendors that impact product availability, and changes in interest rates and availability of credit that impact the nature and timing of customer projects. As such, a liquidity crisis could also have an indirect material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 

Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital or obtain financing in the future. 

As of January 29, 2023, we had total consolidated indebtedness of $1,478 million and $198 million in outstanding lease commitments. In addition, as of January 29, 2023, after giving effect to $12 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, Core & Main LP would have been able to borrow $1,238 million under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. 

Our indebtedness could have important consequences to you. Because of our indebtedness: 

•our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, pay dividends and make other distributions or to purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or for general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future; 

•a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; 

•we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a significant portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; 

•it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness; 

•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

•we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with proportionately less indebtedness or with comparable indebtedness on more favorable terms and, as a result, they may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; 

•our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; 

•our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited; 

•our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions or to purchase, redeem or retire capital stock may be limited; and 

•we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending and restructurings that are necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve our operating margins. 

Despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks to our financial condition and results of operations created by our indebtedness. 

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness provide our subsidiaries with the flexibility to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness in the future, which indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. If our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current indebtedness. In addition, after giving effect to $12 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, as of January 29, 2023, Core & Main LP would have been able to borrow an additional $1,238 million under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations and our ability, and the ability of our future subsidiaries, to engage in certain business and financial transactions, and, as a result, may adversely affect our business or financial condition. 

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of covenants that limit Core & Main LP’s ability and the ability of any of its future restricted subsidiaries to: 

•incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; 

•pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions in respect of capital stock; 

•repurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; 

•make investments; 

•create restrictions on the ability of Core & Main LP’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to Core & Main LP or make other intercompany transfers; 

•incur additional liens; 

•transfer or sell assets; 

•make negative pledges; 

•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Core & Main LP’s assets; 

•change the nature of Core & Main LP’s business; 

•enter into certain transactions with Core & Main LP’s affiliates; and 

•designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 

In addition, the Senior ABL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) requires Core & Main LP to comply with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances and contains other covenants customary for asset-based facilities of this nature. Core & Main LP’s ability to borrow additional amounts under the Senior ABL Credit Facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. 

Core & Main LP is required to make mandatory prepayments under (a) the Senior ABL Credit Facility, if aggregate outstanding borrowings exceed the then applicable borrowing base or the then effective commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, and (b) the Senior Term Loan Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), from excess cash flow, asset sale proceeds, insurance recovery proceeds and proceeds from certain debt incurrences, in each case subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the agreements governing such facilities. In addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us may contain similar restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. 

Our failure to comply with our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness as described above, as well as others contained in any future debt instruments from time to time, may result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. Being forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or not being able to refinance these borrowings could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

The Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of Holdings and the Tax Receivable Agreements limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms.

The Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Holdings (as amended, the “Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of Holdings”) restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness in a manner that would materially and adversely affect Holdings’ ability to make tax distributions to holders of limited partner interests of Holdings (“Partnership Interests”) or distributions to us to fund payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements (as defined below under “Risks Related to our Organizational Structure”). We may be unable to secure additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms as a result of such restriction. 

25

* * *

  


In addition, each of the Tax Receivable Agreements requires that any debt document that refinances or replaces our existing indebtedness be no more restrictive on our ability to make payments under each Tax Receivable Agreement than our current indebtedness, unless CD&R Waterworks Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and the Former Limited Partners (as defined below) (collectively, the “CD&R Investors”) otherwise consent. At the time of any such refinancing or replacing our existing indebtedness, it may not be possible to include such terms in such debt documents, and a result, we may need the CD&R Investors’ consent to complete such refinancing of our existing indebtedness. 

An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could reduce our profitability, increase cash outflows, decrease our liquidity or impact our solvency. 

Our indebtedness under the Senior ABL Credit Facility and under the Senior Term Loan Facility bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could increase the cost of servicing such indebtedness and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of January 29, 2023, assuming all Senior ABL Credit Facility revolving loans were fully drawn, and excluding the impact of any interest rate hedging instruments, each one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in an approximately $27 million increase in annual interest expense on the Senior ABL Credit Facility and the Senior Term Loan Facility. The impact of such an increase would be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of the total amount of our indebtedness. 

Furthermore, the transition to the term secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”) as the benchmark rate for certain of our variable indebtedness may adversely affect our business or financial condition. On July 29, 2022 and February 26, 2023, respectively, we amended the terms of the Senior ABL Credit Facility and Senior Term Loan Facility, in order to, among other things, implement a forward-looking interest rate based on Term SOFR in lieu of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Additionally, in February 2023, we amended the terms of our interest rate swap to, among other things, receive payments based upon the one-month Term SOFR rate. Using Term SOFR as the basis on which interest on the Senior ABL Credit Facility, Senior Term Loan Facility and our interest rate swaps is calculated may result in interest rates and/or payments that do not directly correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Although Term SOFR has been endorsed by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee as its preferred replacement for LIBOR, it remains uncertain whether or when Term SOFR or other alternative reference rates will be widely accepted by lenders as the replacement for LIBOR. This may, in turn, impact the liquidity of the Term SOFR loan market, and Term SOFR itself, with the risk of increased volatility, which could result in higher borrowing costs for us. Further, as the use of Term SOFR-based rates is relatively new, there could be unanticipated difficulties, disruptions or methodological or other changes with the calculation and publication of Term SOFR based rates, which in turn could trigger another benchmark transition or otherwise cause a reliance on an alternate base rate. This could also result in increased borrowing costs for us and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs. 

Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting our industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We cannot provide assurances that our current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. If rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of our securities may be adversely affected. Pressure on the ratings could also arise from higher shareholder payouts or larger acquisitions that result in increased leverage, or in a deterioration in the metrics used by the rating agencies to assess creditworthiness. In addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, impact the ability to obtain adequate financing and result in higher interest costs on future financings.

Our ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control. 

Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness depends on the financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries, which, in turn, depends on their results of operations, cash flows, cash requirements, financial position and general business conditions and any legal restrictions on the payment of distributions to which they may be subject, many of which may be beyond our control. 

We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our indebtedness. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our indebtedness, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. 

26

* * *

  


The Senior ABL Credit Facility matures on July 27, 2026, and the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility mature on July 27, 2028. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness prior to maturity, as a result of prepayment penalties or otherwise, or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our indebtedness. In addition, market disruptions, such as those experienced in 2008 and 2009 and more recently in 2022, as well as our indebtedness levels, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to refinance our obligations as they become due. We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness, at maturity or otherwise, on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or access additional credit, or if short-term or long-term borrowing costs dramatically increase, our ability to finance current operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations could be adversely affected. 

If Core & Main LP cannot make scheduled payments on its indebtedness under the Senior ABL Credit Facility and/or the Senior Term Loan Facility, it will be in default and the lenders under the Senior ABL Credit Facility and/or the Senior Term Loan Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money or foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings, and Core & Main LP could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure 

Our principal asset is our direct and indirect ownership interest in Holdings, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from Holdings and its subsidiaries to pay our taxes and other expenses, including payments under each of the Tax Receivable Agreements. Our subsidiaries’ ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions. 

We are a holding company and our primary asset is our direct and indirect ownership of Holdings. Holdings itself has no operations and no material assets of its own other than its indirect ownership interest in Core & Main Midco, LLC, which is a holding company with no operations and no material assets of its own other than its ownership interest in Core & Main LP and Core & Main Intermediate GP, LLC, the general partner of Core & Main LP. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of our current and future subsidiaries, including Core & Main LP. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including covenants in the agreements that govern Core & Main LP’s indebtedness, will permit such distributions. 

Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income of Holdings, if any, will be allocated to holders of Partnership Interests, including us. Accordingly, we will generally incur U.S. federal income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Holdings. In addition, our allocable share of Holdings’ net taxable income will increase over time as the Continuing Limited Partners continue to exchange their Partnership Interests for shares of our Class A common stock. Such increase in our taxable income may increase our tax expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

In connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with the Former Limited Partners (the “Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement”) and a tax receivable agreement with the Continuing Limited Partners (the “Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement”) (collectively, the “Tax Receivable Agreements”). Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, Holdings is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of Partnership Interests, including us, to the extent that other distributions made by Holdings are otherwise insufficient to pay the tax liabilities of holders of Partnership Interests. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements. Because tax distributions are based on an assumed tax rate, Holdings may be required to make tax distributions that, in the aggregate, could be significant. We intend, as its general partner, to cause Holdings to make cash distributions to the owners of Partnership Interests, including us, in an amount sufficient to (i) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them and (ii) cover our operating expenses, including payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreements. However, Holdings’ ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Holdings is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Holdings insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay taxes or other expenses or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under any Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under such Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under such Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, if Holdings does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock will also be restricted or impaired. See “—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock”.

Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreements, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Limited Partners and certain Former Limited Partners that will not benefit Class A common stockholders to the same extent as it will benefit Continuing Limited Partners or such Former Limited Partners.

Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreements, confers certain benefits upon Continuing Limited Partners and certain Former Limited Partners that will not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it will benefit Continuing Limited Partners or such Former Limited Partners. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Continuing Limited Partners and Former Limited Partners exchanges of Partnership Interests may generate tax attributes for the Company for which we must pay 85% of the realized, or deemed to be realized, benefits to the exchanging party under the respective Tax Receivable Agreement. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the trading market for the Class A common stock. In addition, our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreements, imposes additional compliance costs and requires a significant commitment of resources that would not be required of a company with a simpler organizational structure. 

The Tax Receivable Agreements require us to make cash payments to the Continuing Limited Partners and certain Former Limited Partners in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.

As described in greater detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the Tax Receivable Agreements, we are required to make cash payments to the Continuing Limited Partners or their permitted transferees and to certain Former Limited Partners or their permitted transferees. The amount of the cash payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreements is expected to be substantial. Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreements will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreements. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements are not conditioned on any holder’s continued ownership of Partnership Interests or our common stock. As of January 29, 2023, the Company had recorded a $185 million payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements. 

In addition, if the Continuing Limited Partners exchanged their remaining Partnership Interests on January 29, 2023, utilizing assumptions described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we would recognize a deferred tax asset (subject to offset with existing deferred tax liabilities) of approximately $511 million and a Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement liability of approximately $434 million, payable to the Continuing Limited Partners over the life of the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. The full exchange by the Continuing Limited Partners will also decrease our aforementioned deferred tax asset associated with our investment in Holdings by $145 million. These amounts are estimates only and are subject to change. The actual amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by the holders of Partnership Interests, the amount of gain recognized by such holders of Partnership Interests, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the federal tax rates then applicable.

In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements to Continuing Limited Partners or Former Limited Partners may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements. 

Each Tax Receivable Agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, nonpayment for a specified period which constitutes a material breach of a material obligation under such Tax Receivable Agreement, or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of such Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or our successor’s obligations, under such Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments thereunder would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to such Tax Receivable Agreement.

* * *

  


As a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make payments under such Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to such Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) if we elect to terminate such Tax Receivable Agreement early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the specified percentage of the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of such Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. Based upon certain assumptions, described in greater detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we estimate that if we exercised our termination right as of January 29, 2023, the amount of the termination payment pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the exchange of Partnership Interests would be approximately $123 million and the amount of the termination payment to Continuing Limited Partners holding the remaining exchangeable Partnership Interests would be approximately $262 million. The foregoing numbers are estimates and the actual payments could differ materially based on, among other things, the timing of an early termination election, the discount rate applicable at the time of the early termination election and material changes in relevant tax law. In these situations, our payments under such Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements.

We will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreements in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed. 

Our acquisitions of Partnership Interests in connection with the Exchange Agreement are expected to result in increases in our allocable tax basis in the assets of Holdings that otherwise would not have been available to us. These increases in tax basis are expected to reduce the amount of cash tax that we would otherwise have to pay in the future due to increases in depreciation and amortization deductions (for tax purposes). These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain assets of Holdings to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases, and a court could sustain such a challenge. 

Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS or another taxing authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such challenge. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the actual amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, future tax rates, and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that, as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Holdings attributable to our interests in Holdings, during the expected term of the Tax Receivable Agreements, the payments that we may make to the Continuing Limited Partners could be substantial. 

The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements are our obligation and not an obligation of Holdings. In the event any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made are successfully challenged, such prior payments under the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements will not be reimbursed but any such detriment will generally be taken into account as a reduction in future payments due under the applicable Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if any of our tax reporting positions are challenged by a taxing authority, we will not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under such Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is finally settled or determined. As a result, payments could be made under such Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of the tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes that are the subject of such Tax Receivable Agreement. 

If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a result of our ownership of Holdings, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.

* * *

  


As the general partner of Holdings, we control and operate Holdings. On that basis, we believe that our interest in Holdings is neither an “investment security” as that term is used in the 1940 Act nor a “security” based on the test under applicable case law. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of Holdings, our interest in Holdings could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes of the 1940 Act. 

We and Holdings intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock

The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could decline. 

Volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are: 

•industry, regulatory or general market conditions; 

•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; 

•new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; 

•lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities; 

•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; 

•lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts or changes in any securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance; 

•action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales of our Class A common stock; 

•failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices; 

•announcements by us of significant impairment charges; 

•speculation in the press or investment community; 

•investor perception of us or our industry; 

•changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; 

•the impact of short selling or the impact of a potential “short squeeze” resulting from a sudden increase in demand for our Class A common stock; 

•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships; 

•war, terrorist acts, epidemic disease or pandemic disease; 

•any future sales of our Class A common stock or other securities; 

•additions or departures of key personnel; and 

•misconduct or other improper actions of our associates. 

Stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.

An active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. 

Although our Class A common stock is currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CNM,” an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. Accordingly, if an active trading market for our Class A common stock is not maintained, the liquidity of our Class A common stock, your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired and the prices that you may obtain for your shares of Class A common stock will be adversely affected.

Future sales of shares by us or our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.

Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.

As of January 29, 2023, we had a total of 172,765,161 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 73,229,675 additional shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of Partnership Interests (with automatic retirement of an equal number of shares of Class B common stock). Of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, all of the Class A common stock shares sold in our IPO and Secondary Offerings are immediately tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), except for any shares held by “affiliates,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”). As of January 29, 2023, 100,526,523 shares of our Class A common stock were restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but were eligible for resale subject to applicable volume, means of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 701 under the Securities Act, or “Rule 701,” subject to any lock-up agreements.

Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement and subject to certain restrictions set forth therein and as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Continuing Limited Partners have the right to exchange their Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of our Class B common stock, for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at the election of a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors, for cash from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale (based on the price of our Class A common stock sold in such public offering or private sale), net of any underwriting discounts and commissions, for each Partnership Interest exchanged, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and other similar transactions. The Exchange Agreement also provides that in connection with any such exchange, to the extent that Holdings has, since consummation of the Reorganization Transactions and our IPO, made distributions to the applicable Continuing Limited Partner that are proportionately lesser or greater than the distributions made to us, on a pro rata basis, the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued or cash to be paid to such Continuing Limited Partner will be adjusted to take into account the amount of such discrepancy that is allocable to the Partnership Interests, and Class B common stock, subject to such exchange. We expect to cause Holdings to make overall distributions to its partners in such a manner as generally to limit increases to the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued or cash to be paid to exchanging Continuing Limited Partners in connection with the adjustment described in the preceding sentence. The amount of future partner distributions and the number of shares issuable pursuant to such provision of the Exchange Agreement will fluctuate based on a number of factors, including our financial performance, the actual tax rates applied to the applicable Continuing Limited Partners (or their permitted transferees), any changes in tax rates or tax laws and future share prices for our Class A common stock. Unless our board of directors elects to settle these obligations in cash pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, we expect that these arrangements will result in a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock being issued to the Continuing Limited Partners. 

On July 23, 2021, we also filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of Class A common stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans. As a result, all shares of Class A common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options and other securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Class A common stock granted under our equity compensation plans will be freely tradable under the Securities Act, subject to the terms of the lock-up agreements, unless purchased by our affiliates. Furthermore, as of January 29, 2023, there were (i) common units of Core & Main Management Feeder, LLC (“Management Feeder”), which correspond to an equivalent number of Partnership Interests in Holdings that may be exchanged for 12,196,099 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate, which will be issuable upon exchange of such Partnership Interests (together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock held by Management Feeder), (ii) unvested common units of Management Feeder, that are subject to certain time-vesting provisions, which correspond to an equivalent number of Partnership Interests in Holdings that may be exchanged for 758,202 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate, which will be issuable upon exchange of such Partnership Interests (together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock held by Management Feeder) and (iii) stock appreciation rights of Holdings, denominated in Class A common stock, pursuant to which 556,039 shares of Class A common stock will be issuable, at a weighted average base price of $4.65 per share, of which stock appreciation rights representing 376,496 shares of Class A common stock are vested and exercisable as of January 29, 2023.

The CD&R Investors control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders. 

As of January 29, 2023, the CD&R Investors beneficially owned shares of our common stock representing approximately 65.4% of the combined voting power of our common stock through its ownership of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As a result, the CD&R Investors have sufficient voting power without the consent of our other stockholders to be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. 

Because the CD&R Investors’ interests may differ from your interests, actions the CD&R Investors take as our controlling stockholders may not be favorable to you. For example, the concentration of voting power held by the CD&R Investors could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of us, impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that another stockholder may otherwise view favorably or cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders. Other potential conflicts could arise, for example, over matters such as associate retention or recruiting, or our dividend policy. 

Furthermore, as long as the CD&R Investors continue to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the CD&R Investors will be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of the members of our board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets. Even if the CD&R Investors cease to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock, they will likely still be able to assert significant influence over our board of directors and certain corporate actions. The CD&R Investors have the right to designate for nomination for election to our board of directors at least a majority of our directors and to designate the Chair of our board of directors as long as the CD&R Investors (together with their affiliates) collectively beneficially own shares of our common stock and our other equity securities representing at least 50% and 25%, respectively, of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock and our other equity securities. 

Under our Certificate of Incorporation, the CD&R Investors and their affiliates and, in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, member or partner of the CD&R Investors and their affiliates, have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities. 

The policies relating to corporate opportunities and transactions with the CD&R Investors set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation address potential conflicts of interest between Core & Main, on the one hand, and the CD&R Investors and their respective officers, directors, employees, members or partners who are directors or officers of our company, on the other hand. In accordance with those policies, the CD&R Investors may pursue corporate opportunities, including acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, without offering those opportunities to us. By becoming a stockholder in Core & Main, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation. Although these provisions are designed to resolve conflicts between us and the CD&R Investors and their affiliates fairly, conflicts may not be resolved in our favor or be resolved at all. 

Future offerings of debt, Class A common stock, equity securities which would rank senior to our Class A common stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable into common or preferred stock, in connection with a financing, strategic investment, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise, may result in dilution to owners of our Class A common stock and/or may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. 

If, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our Class A common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Issuing additional shares of our Class A common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our Class A common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors outside our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Class A common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings, reducing the market price of our Class A common stock or diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.

In addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock in connection with a financing, strategic investment, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. 

Anti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us even if our stockholders might consider such changes to be favorable. For example, our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws collectively: 

•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt; 

•provide for a classified board of directors, which divides our board of directors into three classes, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting; 

•limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors if the CD&R Investors (together with their affiliates) cease to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 40% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock; 

•provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; 

•prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders if the CD&R Investors (together with their affiliates) cease to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 40% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock; 

•prohibit stockholder action by consent in writing or electronic transmission, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, if the CD&R Investors (together with their affiliates) cease to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 40% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock; 

•opt out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested stockholder, or any successor provision to Section 203, until Section 203 by its terms would, but for the applicable provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, apply to us and the CD&R Investors (together with their affiliates) cease to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 5% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock; 

•establish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and 

•require the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock then entitled to vote thereon to amend our By-laws and certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation if the CD&R Investors (together with their affiliates) cease to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 40% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 

These provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context or from changing our management and board of directors. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant amount of the total voting power that the CD&R Investors have, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

We could be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility, which could divert management’s attention and materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition. 

The stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. A certain degree of stock price volatility can be attributed to being a newly public company. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In certain situations in which the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. We may be a target of this type of litigation in the future. The defense and disposition of litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and divert resources and the time and attention of our management, which could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition. 

We currently do not have an approved plan to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment depends on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock. 

While we may in the future consider approving a plan to pay dividends on our Class A common stock, we currently intend to use our future earnings, if any, to repay debt, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Therefore, there is no certainty as to the timing, frequency or magnitude of any dividends that we may pay on our Class A common stock, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock depends upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our Class A common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. Payments of dividends, if any, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal and tax restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our Class A common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, the agreements governing our subsidiaries’ debt agreements significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us, and we may enter into other debt agreements or borrowing arrangements in the future that restrict or limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock. In addition, Delaware law imposes additional requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. 

We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and, as a result, currently rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. 

The CD&R Investors control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we expect to continue to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including: 

•the requirement that our Nominating and Governance Committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and

•the requirement that we have a Compensation Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.

We currently intend to continue to utilize the exemptions from the requirements that each of the Nominating and Governance Committee and Compensation Committee be composed entirely of independent directors. As a result, each of our Nominating and Governance Committee and Compensation Committee do not consist entirely of independent directors. Consequently, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance rules and requirements. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.

At such time as the CD&R Investors no longer control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we will no longer be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. The NYSE rules require that we have at least one independent director on each of the Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees on the date we no longer qualify as a “controlled company,” have at least a majority of independent directors on each of the Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees within 90 days of such date and that the Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees be composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date. During this transition period, we may continue to utilize the exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by the NYSE rules. Accordingly, during the transition period, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Furthermore, a change in our board of directors and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operation philosophies, and may result in deviations from our current strategy. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or stockholders. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or our By-laws (as either may be amended or restated) or the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to such Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. It is possible that a court could find that the exclusive forum provisions described above are inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provision is unenforceable, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. As permitted by Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the election of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. To the fullest extent permitted by law, by becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Additionally, a court could determine that the exclusive forum provision is unenforceable, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.
