Description of our business

We are a designer, manufacturer and marketer of performance-defining products and systems used primarily on bikes, side-by-sides, on-road vehicles with and without off-road capabilities, off-road vehicles and trucks, ATVs, snowmobiles, and specialty vehicles and applications. We believe our products offer innovative design, performance, durability and reliability. Our brand is associated with high-performance and technologically advanced products, by which we generally mean products that provide users with improved control and comfort while riding over rough terrain in varied environments, or providing improved control and responsiveness for on-road only vehicles. We believe that the performance of our products has been demonstrated by, and our brand benefits from, the success of professional athletes who use our products in elite competitive events, such as the Olympic Games, the Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike World Cup, the X Games and the Baja 1000. We believe the exposure our products receive when used by successful professional athletes positively influences the purchasing habits of enthusiasts and other consumers seeking high-performance products. We believe that our strategic focus on the performance and racing segments in our markets influences many aspiring and enthusiast consumers who we believe seek to emulate the performance of professional and other elite athletes. We believe our products are generally sold at premium prices, which to us means manufacturer suggested retail sale prices that are generally in the upper quartile of their respective product categories. 

We design our products for, and market our products to, some of the world’s leading cycling and automotive OEMs and to consumers through the aftermarket channel. Many of our OEM customers, including Specialized, Trek Bicycles, Giant, Orbea, Canyon Bicycles, Santa Cruz Bicycles, and Yeti Cycles in Specialty Sports and BRP, Ford, Polaris, Toyota, 4 Wheel Parts, Kawasaki, Yamaha, and Honda in Powered Vehicles, are among the market leaders in their respective product categories, and help shape, as well as respond to, consumer trends in their respective categories. We believe that OEMs often prominently display and incorporate our products to improve the marketability and consumer demand for their performance models, which reinforces our brand image. In addition, consumers select our products in the aftermarket channel where we market through a global network of dealers and distributors. 

Industry

We participate in large global markets for bikes and powered vehicles used by recreational and professional users. Today, our products for bicycles are primarily for mountain bikes, e-bikes and road bikes. Our products for powered vehicles are used primarily on on-road vehicles with and without off-road capabilities, side-by-sides, off-road vehicles and trucks, ATVs, snowmobiles, specialty vehicles and applications, including military, motorcycles, and commercial trucks. 

We focus on premium-priced products within each of these categories, which we consider to be the high-end segment because of their higher retail sale prices, where we believe consumers prefer well-designed, performance-oriented equipment. We believe that performance-defining products, which include suspension systems, as well as wheels, cranks, and other components, are critical to the performance of the bikes and powered vehicles in the product categories in which we focus and that technical features, component performance, product design, durability, reliability, and brand recognition strongly influence consumer-purchasing decisions.

1

* * *
We believe the high-end segments in which we participate are well positioned for growth due to several factors, including: 

•increasing consumer appetite for performance-defining products;

•increasing average retail sales prices, which we believe are driven by differentiated and feature-rich products with advanced technologies; 

•continuing product cycle innovation, which we have observed often motivates consumers to upgrade and purchase new products for enhanced performance; and

•increasing sales opportunities for high-end bikes and powered vehicles in international markets. 

As vehicles in our end-markets evolve and grow more capable, performance-defining products and systems have become, and we believe will continue to be, increasingly more important for improved performance and control. Additionally, we believe there are opportunities to continue to leverage our technical know-how of suspension products to provide solutions beyond our current applications and end-markets. 

Our competitive strengths 

Broad offering of performance-defining products across multiple consumer markets 

Our performance-defining products enhance vehicle performance across multiple consumer markets. Through the use of adjustable suspension, position sensitive damping, multiple air spring technologies, lightweight and rigid materials, and other technologies and methods, our products improve the performance and control of the vehicles used by our consumers. We believe our reputation for performance-defining products is reinforced by the successful finishes in world class competitive events by athletes incorporating our products in their vehicles. 

Premium brand with strong consumer loyalty 

We believe that we have developed a reputation for performance-defining products and that we own and license established trademarks, such as FOX®, FOX RACING SHOX®, BLACK WIDOW®, ROCKY RIDGE®, RACE FACE® which are perceived as premium brands. As such, our performance-defining products are generally sold at premium prices. We take great effort to maintain our brands in the eyes of consumers. For instance, our FOX® logo is prominently displayed on our FOX® branded products used on bikes and powered vehicles sold by our OEM customers, which helps further reinforce our brand image. We believe that our brands have achieved strong loyalty from our consumers. To support our brands, we introduce new products that we believe feature innovative technologies designed to improve vehicle performance and enhance our brand loyalty with consumers. 

Track record of innovation and new product introductions 

Innovation, including new product development, is a key component of our growth strategy. Due to our experience in suspension engineering and design in multiple markets and with a variety of vehicles, solutions we develop for use in one market can ultimately be deployed across multiple markets. For example, we believe that our success in the high-end ATV category led to the widespread adoption of our suspension technology in the side-by-sides market. Our innovative product development and speed to market are supported by: 

•our racing culture, including on-site technical race support of professional athletes, which provides us with unique real-time insights as to the evolving performance-defining product needs of those participating in challenging world-class events and is an integral part of our research and development efforts; 

•ongoing research and development through a team of full-time engineers and numerous other technicians and employees who spend at least part of their time testing and using our products and helping develop engineering-based solutions to enhance our product offerings;

This technology is used widely across all brands of mountain bikes or as aftermarket upgrades to replace lower performing suspension; 

•The GRIP2 fork damper, which is our next-evolution sealed cartridge FIT system, our highest performing gravity-focused damper. GRIP2 shares its roots with the original GRIP architecture, but has been enhanced with all-new technology: four-way adjustability, VVC high-speed rebound circuit, high-performance mid-valve, and overall friction-reducing treatments. This technology is used widely across all brands of mountain bikes or as aftermarket upgrades to replace lower performing suspension; 

•Rhythm series fork products developed to address a lower price point offering without compromising proven FOX performance;

•FOX AWL suspension fork for the growing electronic sports utility vehicle ("eSUV") commuter and e-mobility segment combining the confidence and stability of off-road capable suspension with the convenience of direct mount compatibility with full wrap fenders, lights, and anti-lock braking systems. This technology is found on a wide range of electric bikes;

•Race Face Vault Hub, a 120-point high-engagement mountain bike hubset featuring tool-free end caps that simplify conversion among all major axle standards and is approved for e-bike applications. This technology is found in select Race Face mountain bike wheels; and

•Easton EC90 SL Crankset, a versatile road bike crankset that allows quick conversion between 1x and 2x road and gravel chainring configurations.

Strategic brand for OEMs, dealers and distributors 

Through our strategic relationships, we are often sought out by our OEM customers and work closely with them to develop and design new products and product enhancements. We believe our collaborative approach and product development processes strengthen our relationships with our OEM customers. We believe consumers value our branded products when selecting performance bikes and powered vehicles, and as a result, OEMs purchase and incorporate our products in their bikes and powered vehicles in order to increase the sales of their premium-priced products. In addition, we believe the inclusion of our products on high-end bikes and powered vehicles reinforces our premium brand image which helps to drive our sales in the aftermarket channel where dealers and distributors sell our products to consumers. 

Experienced management team 

We have an experienced senior management team led by Michael C. Dennison, our Chief Executive Officer. Many members of our management team and many of our employees are avid users of our products, which further extends their knowledge of, and expertise in, our products and end-markets. We are able to attract and retain highly trained and specialized employees who enhance our Company culture and serve as strong brand advocates.

Our strategy 

Our goal is to expand our leadership position as a designer, manufacturer and marketer of performance-defining products designed to enhance ride dynamics and performance. We intend to focus on the following key strategies in pursuit of this goal: 

Continue to develop new and innovative products in current end-markets 

We intend to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products in our current end-markets to improve ride dynamics and performance for our consumers. For example, our patented position-sensitive damping systems provide terrain optimized ride characteristics across many of our product lines. We believe that performance and control are important to our consumer base, and that our frequent introduction of products with innovative and improved technologies increases both OEM and aftermarket demand as consumers seek out products for their vehicles that can deliver these characteristics. We also believe evolving market trends, such as changing bike wheel and tire sizes and increasing adoption rates of off-road capable, on-road trucks should increase demand for vehicles in our end-markets, which, in turn, should increase demand for our suspension products. 

Leverage technology and brand to expand into new categories and end-markets 

We believe innovation is the foundation of our company. As we continue to leverage the latest technology to develop a diverse portfolio of performance-defining products, our Powered Vehicle Group facility extends our ability to not only scale to newer levels but also do it efficiently. We have great relations with our OEM and aftermarket partners and given our key distinct strengths, we believe we have and will continue to win more applications. Leveraging our technology and scale, we have successfully expanded into recreational vehicles and street car applications, and we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate these markets and grow with more pioneering product applications. Additionally, to grow our end user base, we are now looking at ways to explore international opportunities with some of our applications. 

Opportunistically expand our business platform through acquisitions 

Over the past several years, we have completed acquisitions that we believe enhance our business and strategically expand our product offerings. In March 2020, we acquired substantially all the issued and outstanding capital stock of SCA Performance Holdings, Inc. ("SCA"), a leading OEM authorized specialty vehicle manufacturer for light duty trucks and sport utility vehicles. In May 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SCA, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Manifest Joy LLC ("Outside Van), a custom van conversion company that designs and custom engineers recreational vehicles. In December 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shock Therapy Suspension, Inc., we acquired substantially all the assets of Shock Therapy LLC ("Shock Therapy"), a premier suspension tuning company in the off-road industry. The Company expects these acquisitions to expand its North American geographic manufacturing footprint and broaden its product offerings in the automotive industry. We believe there is opportunity to expand our total available market by broadening our acquisition focus to include a more diverse range of performance products that add to or increase our customers' enjoyment of their activities of choice. We also believe that our passionate customer base has a desire for other types of performance products beyond those that attach to a vehicle or bike. 

Our business development group is responsible for identifying and assessing inorganic and organic potential growth opportunities of our ride dynamics platform and other specialty sports technology platforms. Specifically, our business development group: (i) identifies and assesses potential acquisition opportunities; (ii) aids the business in analyzing growth alternatives; and (iii) manages critical projects and programs as determined by senior management. 

Increase our aftermarket penetration 

We currently have a broad aftermarket distribution network of thousands of retail dealers and distributors worldwide. We intend to further penetrate the aftermarket channel by selectively adding dealers and distributors in certain geographic markets, increasing our internal sales force and strategically expanding aftermarket-specific products and services to existing vehicle platforms.

Accelerate international growth 

We believe international expansion represents a significant opportunity for us and we have, and intend to continue to, selectively increase infrastructure investments and focus on identified geographic regions. We believe that rising consumer discretionary income in a number of developing markets and increasing consumer preferences for premium, performance bikes and powered vehicles should contribute to increasing demand for our products. In addition, we believe increasing international viewership of racing and extreme sports and other outdoor events, such as the Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike World Cup and X Games, is contributing to the growth of international participation in activities in which our products are used. We intend to leverage the recognition of our brands to capitalize on these trends by globally increasing our sales to both OEMs and dealers and distributors, particularly in markets where we perceive significant opportunities.

Improve operating and supply chain efficiencies 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the construction of an approximately 336,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility in Hall County, Georgia (the "Gainesville Facility") to diversify our manufacturing platform and provide additional long-term capacity to support growth in our Powered Vehicles Group. The Gainesville Facility is being used for manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and office space. Additionally, we completed the transition of our Watsonville, California facility (the "Watsonville Facility") and the relocation of our powered vehicles suspension manufacturing to the Gainesville Facility in the first quarter of 2022.

Seasonality 

Certain portions of our business are seasonal; we believe this seasonality is due to the delivery of new products. As we have diversified our product offerings and our product launch cycles, seasonal fluctuations are becoming less material.

Competition 

The markets for performance-defining products are highly competitive. We compete with other companies that produce products for sale to OEMs, dealers and distributors, as well as with OEMs that produce their own line of products for their own use. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, research and development or marketing resources than we do. Competition in the high-end segment of the performance-defining market revolves around technical features, performance, product design, innovation, reliability and durability, brand, time to market, customer service and reliable order execution. While the pricing of competing products is always a factor, we believe the performance of our products helps justify our premium pricing. Within our markets, we compete with several large companies and numerous small companies that provide branded and unbranded products across many of our product lines. These competitors can be divided into the following categories: 

Powered Vehicles 

Within the market for off-road and specialty vehicle suspension components, we compete with ThyssenKrupp Bilstein Suspension GmbH (commonly known as Bilstein), King Shock Technology, Inc. (commonly known as King Shocks), Icon Vehicle Dynamics, Sway-A-Way, Pro Comp USA Suspension, and Rancho ("Tenneco"). In the market for suspension systems, or lift kits, we compete with TransAmerican Wholesale/Pro Comp USA, Rough Country Suspension Systems, TeraFlex, Falcon, ReadyLIFT Suspension, Tuff Country EZ-Ride Suspension, and Rusty’s Off-Road. In the market for upfitted vehicles, we compete with Roush Performance and DSI Custom Vehicles.

Within the market for powered vehicle suspension components, we compete with several companies in different submarkets. In the ATV and side-by-sides markets, outside of vertically-integrated OEMs, we compete with ZF Sachs (ZF Friedrichshafen AG), and Walker Evans Racing for OEM business and Elka Suspension Inc., Öhlins Racing AB, Works Performance Products, and Penske Racing Shocks / Custom Axis, Inc. for aftermarket business.

Intellectual property 

Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade names, licensing arrangements, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary technology and we secure and protect our intellectual property rights. 

Our intellectual property counsel diligently protects our new technologies with patents and trademarks and defends against patent infringement allegations. We patent our proprietary technologies related to vehicle suspension and other products in the U.S. and various foreign patent offices. Our principal intellectual property also includes our registered trademarks in the U.S. and a number of international jurisdictions, including the marks FOX®, FOX RACING SHOX® and REDEFINE YOUR LIMITS®. Although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and constitutes a valuable asset in the aggregate, we do not believe that any single patent, trademark or trade secret is critical to the success of our business as a whole. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. 

In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information using internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, OEMs, distributors and others. 

Customers 

Our OEM customers include market leaders in their respective categories, and they help define, as well as respond to, consumer trends in their respective industries. These OEM customers include our products on a number of their performance models. We believe OEMs often use our products to improve the marketability and demand of their own products, which, in turn, strengthens our brand image. In addition, consumers select our performance-defining products in the aftermarket channel, where we market through a global network of dealers and distributors. We currently sell to approximately 100 OEMs and distribute our products to more than 5,000 retail dealers and distributors worldwide. In 2022, 57% of our sales resulted from sales to OEM customers and 43% resulted from sales to dealers and distributors for resale in the aftermarket channel. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.

Sales attributable to our 10 largest OEM customers, which can vary from year-to-year, collectively accounted for approximately 35%, 35% and 36% of our sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single customer represented 10% or more of our sales. 

Although we refer to the branded bike OEMs that use our products throughout this document as "our customers," "our OEM customers" or "our bike OEM customers," branded bike OEMs often use contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble their bikes. As a result, even though we typically negotiate price and volume requirements directly with our bike OEM customers, the contract manufacturer may place the purchase order and therefore assumes the payment responsibilities. 

Our North American sales totaled $1,009.2 million, $811.3 million, and $593.3 million, or 63%, 62% and 67%, of our total sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our international sales totaled $593.3 million, $487.8 million and $297.3 million or 37%, 38% and 33% of our total sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales attributable to countries outside the U.S. are based on shipment location. Our international sales, however, do not necessarily reflect the location of the end users of our products, as many of our products are incorporated into bikes and powered vehicles that are assembled at international locations and then shipped back to the U.S. Additional information about our product revenues and certain geographical information is available in Note 2. Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Powered Vehicles 

We sell our powered vehicle suspension products to OEMs, including BRP, Ford, Polaris, Toyota, Kawasaki, Yamaha, and Honda. We also are continually nurturing and developing relationships with our existing and new OEMs, as the powered vehicles market continues to grow. After incorporating our products on their powered vehicles, OEMs typically sell their powered vehicles to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 

In the aftermarket, we typically sell suspension products to dealers and distributors, both domestically and internationally. Our dealers sell directly to consumers. When we sell to our distributors, they sell to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. In our upfitting product category, we sell to a broad network of automotive dealerships.

We have long-standing relationships with many of the top bike OEMs. After incorporating our products on their bikes, OEMs typically sell their bikes to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 

In the aftermarket, we typically sell to U.S. dealers and through distributors internationally. Our dealers sell directly to aftermarket consumers. Our overseas distributors sell to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 

Sales and marketing 

We employ specialized and dedicated sales professionals. Each sales professional is fully responsible for servicing either OEM or aftermarket customers within our product categories, which ensures that our customers are in contact with capable and knowledgeable sales professionals to address their specific needs. We strongly believe that providing a high level of service to our end customers is essential to maintaining our reputational excellence in the marketplace. Our sales professionals receive training on the brands' latest products and technologies and attend trade shows and events to increase their market knowledge. 

Our marketing strategy focuses on strengthening and promoting our brands in the marketplace. We strategically focus our marketing efforts on enthusiasts seeking high-end, performance-defining products and systems through promotions at destination riding locations and individual and team sponsorships. We believe the performance of our products has been demonstrated by, and our brands benefit from, the success of professional athletes who use our products in elite competitive events such as the Olympic Games, the Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike World Cup, the X Games and the Baja 1000. We also believe these successes positively influence the purchasing habits of enthusiasts and other consumers seeking performance-defining products. 

We believe that our strategic focus on the performance and racing segments in our markets, including our sponsorships of a number of professional athletes and race teams, influences many aspiring and enthusiast consumers and enables our products to be sold at premium price points. In order to continue to enhance our brand image, we will need to maintain our position in the suspension products industry and to continue to provide high-quality products and services. 

We have also been able to develop long-term strategic relationships with leading OEMs. Our reputation for performance-defining products plays a critical role in our aftermarket sales to consumers. 

In addition to our websites and traditional marketing channels, such as print advertising and tradeshows, we maintain an active social media presence, including an Instagram feed, Facebook page, YouTube channel, Vimeo channel and Twitter feed to increase brand awareness, foster loyalty and build a community of users. As strategies and marketing plans are developed for our products, our internal marketing and communications group works to ensure brand cohesion and consistency. 

Manufacturing and backlog

We manufacture and complete final assembly on most of our products. By controlling the manufacturing process of our products, we can maintain our strict quality standards, customize our machines and processes for the specific requirements of our products, and quickly respond to feedback we receive on our products in development and otherwise. Furthermore, manufacturing our own products enables us to adjust our labor and production inputs to meet seasonal demands and the customized requirements of some of our customers. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the construction of our Gainesville Facility to diversify our manufacturing platform and provide additional long-term capacity to support growth in our Powered Vehicles Group. The Gainesville Facility is being used for manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and office space. Additionally, we completed the transition of our Watsonville Facility and relocation of our powered vehicles suspension manufacturing to the Gainesville Facility in the first quarter of 2022.

We had approximately $116.7 million and $223.5 million in firm backlog orders at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in 2022 backlog, as compared to 2021, is due to many factors including the normalization of supply chain shortages that were experienced in 2021, the realignment of production forecasts with some of our large OEM customers, and increased production at our Gainesville Facility.

Suppliers and raw materials

The primary raw materials used in the production of our products are aluminum, magnesium, carbon and steel. We generally use multiple suppliers for our raw materials and believe that our raw materials are in adequate supply and available from many suppliers at competitive prices. We do, however, depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our components. If our current suppliers for such components are unable to timely fill orders, or if we are required to transition to other suppliers, we could experience significant production delays or disruption to our business. Please read Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations \- "We depend on a limited number of suppliers for our materials and component parts for some of our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers or an increase in cost of raw materials could harm our business." In addition, prices for our raw materials fluctuate. While we have been able to mitigate the impacts of price fluctuations on our business historically, we are actively monitoring the current market conditions and price trends.

We also have OEM partners that supply vehicle chassis used in our upfitting operations. Our operations could be negatively impacted if we are not able to receive vehicle chassis according to our production needs, or if an OEM decides to discontinue supplying chassis for other reasons. 

We work closely with our supply base, and depend upon certain suppliers to provide raw inputs, such as forgings, castings and molded polymers that have been optimized for weight, structural integrity, wear and cost. In certain circumstances, we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for such raw inputs. We typically have no firm contractual sourcing agreements with our suppliers other than purchase orders. 

Miyaki is the exclusive producer of the Kashima coating for our suspension component tubes. As part of our agreement with Miyaki, or the Kashima Agreement, we have been granted the exclusive right to use the trademark "KASHIMACOAT" on products comprising the aluminum finished parts for suspension components (e.g., tubes) and on related sales and marketing material worldwide, subject to a minimum model year order and certain other exclusions. The Kashima Agreement does not contain minimum purchase obligations.

Human Capital Resources

Employee Overview

As of December 30, 2022, we had approximately 4,400 employees in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Taiwan and Australia. Our employees are primarily located in the U.S. We also use temporary employees at our manufacturing facilities to help us meet seasonal demands. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 

Health and Safety 

Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our top priorities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working to keep our employees safe and healthy from this outbreak. Using guidance from the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC"), the World Health Organization ("WHO"), and the various states and counties in which we operate, we have taken a number of measures to keep employees safe. Employees are offered paid sick leave or paid time off to cover sickness and absences. We will continue to make our employees a priority. 

Inclusion, Diversity and Engagement

At FOX, we believe that people are our greatest asset. Therefore, we are committed to building and maintaining an inclusive workplace in which all employees feel they belong, are empowered to be their best, and inspired to deliver maximum performance. Our employees have diverse skills, experiences and unique perspectives that collectively contribute to greater opportunities for engagement, innovation and business growth. Our commitment to Inclusion, Diversity, and Engagement aligns with our values of Leadership, Trust, Service, Agility, Ingenuity, and Collaboration and is a critical component of being a purpose-led organization.

•build a globally diverse, high-performing workforce that mirrors the populations around us;

•foster an inclusive workplace culture where all feel like they are heard, welcomed, valued, and empowered; and

•engage our people in making an impact in the marketplace where we live, work, and play.

Practices related to working capital items 

The Company does not believe that it, or the industry in general, has any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are material to understanding our business. Information about the Company’s working capital is incorporated herein by reference to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Government regulation 

Environmental 

Our manufacturing operations, facilities and properties in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Taiwan are subject to evolving foreign, international, federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, costs, liabilities or restrictions on operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition. 

We believe that our operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and our compliance with such laws and regulations has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material impact on our earnings or competitive position. However, new requirements, more stringent application of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions could result in material environmental related expenditures in the future. For example, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules for extensive and prescriptive climate-related disclosures in annual reports and registration statements, which would also require inclusion of certain climate-related financial metrics in a note to companies’ audited financial statements. Please read "Risks Related to Laws and Regulations - Increasing focus on environmental, social and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks" within Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Employment 

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local government laws and regulations governing our relationships with our employees, including those relating to minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination, work permits and employee benefits. We believe that our operations are conducted in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations. We have never experienced a material work stoppage or disruption to our business relating to employee matters. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 

Consumer safety 

We are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), and other federal, state and foreign regulatory bodies including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA"), which enforces the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standards. Under CPSC regulations, a manufacturer of consumer goods is obligated to notify the CPSC, if, among other things, the manufacturer becomes aware that one of its products has a defect that could create a substantial risk of injury. If the manufacturer has not already undertaken to do so, the CPSC may require a manufacturer to recall a product, which may involve product repair, replacement or refund. During the past three years, we initiated two voluntary product recalls. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Government contracts 

No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. 

Financial information about segments and geographic areas

We operate in one reportable segment: manufacturing, sale and service of performance-defining products. Additional information about our product segment and certain geographic information is available in Note 2. Revenues and Note 5. Property, Plant and Equipment, net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
