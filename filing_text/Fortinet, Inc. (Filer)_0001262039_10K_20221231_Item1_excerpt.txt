Part I

ITEM 1. Business 

Overview

  


Fortinet is a global leader in cybersecurity and networking solutions for organizations, including enterprises, communication service providers, security service providers, government organizations and small businesses.

  


The focus areas of our business consist of:

  


•Secure Networking—Our Secure Networking solutions enable the convergence of networking and security across all edges to provide next-generation firewall (“NGFW”), software-defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”), LAN Edge (Wi-Fi and switch) and secure access service edge (“SASE”). Traditional networking lacks awareness of content, applications, users, devices, location and more. A secure networking approach converges networking and security into a single, accelerated solution. A specially designed operating system and security processors work in concert to improve network performance and security posture while decreasing footprint and power consumption. We derive a majority of product sales from our Core Platform (previously referred to as FortiGate) network security appliances. Core Platform network security appliances include a broad set of built-in security and networking features and functionalities, including firewall, next-generation firewall, secure web gateway, secure sockets layer (“SSL”) inspection, SD-WAN, intrusion prevention system (“IPS”), sandboxing, data leak prevention, virtual private network (“VPN”), switch and wireless controller and wide area network (“WAN”) edge. Our network security appliances are managed by our FortiOS network operating system, which provides the foundation for Core Platform security functions. We enhance the performance of our network security appliances from branch to data center by designing and implementing Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASIC”) technology within our appliances, enabling us to add security and network functionality with minimal impact to network throughput performance. Along with our secure Wi-Fi access points and switches, Fortinet helps organizations secure their networks across campuses, branches and work from anywhere (“WFA”) deployments. For the Japanese market, we also offer high performance network switches marketed under Alaxala Networks Corporation for data center switching.

  


FortiOS supports many more secure networking markets and applications than just firewall. These include:

  


•Network Firewall (“NFW”)

•Software-Defined Wide Area Network (“SD-WAN”)

•Secure LAN/WLAN (Wi-Fi and Switch) (SD-Branch/Campus)

•Secure Access Service Edge (“SASE”)

•Universal Zero Trust Network Access (“ZTNA”)

•Encryption Applications (SSL Inspection, Virtual Private Network (“VPN”), and IPsec Connectivity)

  


  


Further each security application has number of customer use cases. For example, Network Firewall has the following use cases:

  


•Data Center Perimeter NGFW

•North–South Internal Segmentation Firewall

•Distributed Network Edge Firewall

•East–West Micro Segmentation Firewall

•Virtual Firewall (“VM”)

•Cloud Native Firewall (“CNF”)

•Firewall as a Service (“FWaaS”)

•Containerized Firewall

•Endpoint Firewall

•SMB Firewall

•Home Firewall

  


•Zero Trust Access—Our Zero Trust Access solutions enable customers to know and control who and what is on their network, in addition to providing security for WFA. Zero Trust Access solutions include FortiNAC,

* * *
FortiAuthenticator, FortiClient/EDR and FortiToken. Our network access control solutions provide visibility, control and automated event responses in order to secure internet of things (“IoT”) and OT devices.

  


•Cloud Security—We help customers connect securely to and across their individual, hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud and virtualized data center environments by offering security through our virtual firewall and other software products and through integrated capabilities with major cloud platforms. Our public and private cloud security solutions, including virtual appliances and hosted solutions, extend the core capabilities of Fortinet’s cybersecurity mesh architecture (“Fortinet Security Fabric”) in and across cloud environments, delivering security that follows their applications and data. Our solutions include network security, web application firewall and application programming interface (“API”) protection, cloud-native security and workload protection. Our Secure SD-WAN for multi-cloud solution automates deployment of an overlay network across different cloud networks and offers visibility, control and centralized management that integrates functionality across multiple cloud environments. Our cloud security portfolio also includes securing applications in all environments in which they can be deployed, including physical and virtual data centers, cloud and edge compute instances. Fortinet cloud security offerings are available for deployment in major public and private cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and VMWare Cloud. We also offer managed web application firewall (“WAF”) rules delivered by FortiGuard Labs as an overlay service to native security offerings offered by Amazon Web Services.

  


•AI-Driven Security Operations—We develop and provide a range of products and services that enable the security operations center (“SOC”) teams to identify, investigate and remediate potential incidents in which cybercriminals bypass prevention-oriented controls. Given the breadth of the attack surface to monitor, as well as the volume and sophistication of cyber threats, artificial intelligence (“AI”) is a key part of these offerings, which include: FortiGuard and other security subscription services, endpoint security with endpoint detection and response (“EDR”), a range of breach-protection technologies plus our security information and event management (“SIEM”) and security orchestration, automation and response (“SOAR”), all of which can be applied across the Fortinet Security Fabric. These solutions automatically deliver security intelligence and insights that help organizations to protect against and respond to threats through integration with Fortinet and third-party solutions.

  


•FortiGuard Security Services—FortiGuard security services counter threats in real time with AI-powered, coordinated protection. All of our security services are natively integrated into the Fortinet Security Fabric. This enables fast detection and enforcement across the entire attack surface. Risk is continually assessed and the Security Fabric automatically adjusts to counter the latest known and unknown threats in real time. It is able to close security gaps with context-aware, consistent security policies for users and applications in hybrid deployments across the network, endpoints and clouds. 

  


•Support and Professional Services—FortiCare Technical Support Service is a per-device support service, which provides customers access to experts to ensure efficient and effective operations and maintenance of their Fortinet capabilities. Global technical support is offered 24x7 with flexible add-ons, including enhanced service level agreements (“SLAs”) and premium hardware replacement through in-country depots. Organizations have the flexibility to procure different levels of service for different devices based on their availability needs. We offer three per-device support options tailored to the needs of our enterprise customers: FortiCare Premium, FortiCare Elite and FortiCare Essential. The newly launched FortiCare Elite service provides 15-minute response times for key product families. 

  


During our year ended December 31, 2022, we generated total revenue of $4.42 billion and net income of $857.3 million. See Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and our consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

  


We were incorporated in Delaware in November 2000. Our principal executive office is located at 899 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086 and our telephone number at that location is (408) 235-7700. 

  


Consolidation of Technology and Architecture

  


Cybersecurity has traditionally been deployed one solution at a time and not designed to work well with other deployed solutions while also increasing management complexity. A Fortinet Security Fabric approach consolidates point products into a platform, allowing for much tighter integration, increased automation and a more rapid, coordinated and effective response to threats across the network. The Fortinet Security Fabric has an open architecture designed to integrate Fortinet solutions and third-party solutions.

* * *
Our product offerings consist of our Core Platform network security products and our Enhanced Platform Technology (previously referred to as Platform Extension) products, which are offered in a broad range of form factors spanning physical appliances, virtual appliances, software and cloud-hosted services. This enables us to protect customers across all edges and deployment scenarios including users, devices, networks, cloud and virtual data center. Our cloud- and hosted- products and services include sandboxing, EDR, email security, web application and API security, cloud networking security and cloud-native protection as well as Fortinet Security Fabric management and analytics. Additionally, we offer cloud-delivered and hosted-security services. Our FortiGuard security services are enabled by FortiGuard Labs, which provides threat research and artificial intelligence capabilities from a cloud network to deliver protection through Core Platform appliance and virtual machine as well as Fortinet Security Fabric products that are registered by the end-customer. All these are combined to form the Fortinet Security Fabric, which is an approach to security that consolidates discrete security solutions together into an integrated offering. This integrated approach to security extends across both Fortinet-developed solutions and a broad ecosystem of technology partner solutions and technologies.

  


ASIC

  


Our proprietary FortiASIC technology family consists of three processors. First, a Network Processor Generation 7, FortiNP 7 (“NP 7”), which accelerates the processing of firewall traffic and offloads this function from the central processing unit (“CPU”). Second, a Content Processor Generation 9, FortiCP (“CP 9”), helps the CPU with deep packets inspection functions, such as intrusion prevention and antivirus. Multiple NP7s and CP 9s can be placed in larger firewalls to provide more scale. Third, the central CPU, network processing and content processing functions are all brought together in a single ASIC called the Security Processor Generation 5. These Fortinet Proprietary ASICs, along with off-the-shelf CPU/ASICs, allow our systems to scale from the smallest branch to a hyperscale cloud and run multiple applications at high performance. 

  


The use of ASICs allows our appliances to consolidate security functionality and converge security with a minimal impact to network throughput performance, which we believe delivers a lower total cost of ownership (“TCO”) to our customers. As the security needs and technologies of our end-customers increase, we believe our TCO-driven ASIC approach give our products a competitive advantage against other architectural approaches.

  


FortiOS

  


FortiOS, its associated security and networking functions and products that run or are integrated with FortiOS are combined to form the Fortinet Security Fabric. This approach to security ties discrete security solutions together into an integrated offering.

  


Our proprietary FortiOS operating system provides the foundation for the operation of Core Platform network security appliances, whether physical, virtual, private- or public-cloud based. We make regular enhancements and other updates to FortiOS available through our FortiCare support services.

  


The convergence of security and networking capabilities provided by the Fortinet Security Fabric are powered and controlled through FortiOS. FortiOS provides (i) multiple layers of security, including a hardened kernel layer providing protection for the Core Platform system, (ii) a network security layer, providing security for end-customers’ network infrastructures and (iii) application content protection, providing security for end-customers’ workstations and applications. FortiOS directs the operations of processors and ASICs and provides system management functions such as command line, graphical user interfaces, multiple network and security topology views.

  


FortiOS also enables advanced, integrated routing and switching, allowing end-customers to deploy Core Platform devices within a wide variety of networks, as well as providing a direct replacement solution option for legacy switching and routing equipment. FortiOS implements a suite of commonly used standards-based routing protocols as well as network address translation technologies, allowing the Core Platform appliance to integrate and operate in a wide variety of network environments. Additional features include virtual domain capabilities, which can provide support for multiple customers on a single device or FortiOS instance in support of service provider and managed security service provider (“MSSP”) deployments. FortiOS also provides traffic-logging capabilities for forensic analysis purposes. FortiOS is designed to help control network traffic in order to optimize performance by including functionality such as packet classification, queue disciplines, policy enforcement, congestion management, WAN optimization and caching.

Manufacturing and Suppliers

  


We outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Our current manufacturing partners include ADLINK Technology, Inc. (“ADLINK”), IBASE Technology, Inc. (“IBASE”), Micro-Star International Co. (“Micro-Star”), Senao Networks, Inc. (“Senao”), Wistron Corporation (“Wistron”) and a number of other manufacturers. Approximately 88% of our hardware is manufactured in Taiwan. We submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery date and other delivery terms. Once our products are manufactured, they are sent to either our warehouse in California or to our logistics partner in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, where accessory packaging and quality-control testing are performed. We believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies. Our proprietary ASICs, which are key to the performance of our appliances, are built by contract manufacturers including Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. (“Toshiba America”) and Renesas Electronics America, Inc. (“Renesas”). These contract manufacturers use foundries in Taiwan and Japan operated by either Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”) or by the contract manufacturer itself.

  


The components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or, more frequently, by our contract manufacturers. Some of the components important to our business, including certain CPUs from Intel Corporation (“Intel”) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”), network and wireless chips from Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”), Marvell Technology

* * *
Group Ltd. (“Marvell”), Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) and Intel and memory devices from Intel, Micron Technology (“Micron”), ADATA Technology Co., Ltd. (“ADATA”), Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”), and Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (“Western Digital”), are available from limited or sole sources of supply.

  


We have no long-term contracts related to the manufacturing of our ASICs or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms.

  


Research and Development

  


We focus our research and development efforts on developing new hardware and software products and services, and adding new features to existing products and services. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that are, or are expected to be, important to our end-customers. Our success in designing, developing, manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors, including identification of market demand for new products or new features, components selection, timely implementation of product design and development, product performance, quality, ease of use, costs of development, bill of materials, effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing.

  


Intellectual Property 

  


We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. We periodically have discussions with third parties regarding licensing Fortinet’s intellectual property (“IP”) and have sometimes taken legal action against competitors to protect our IP, and as a result third parties have paid us fees in return for licenses or covenants-not-to-sue related to Fortinet IP. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,285 U.S. and foreign-issued patents and 255 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software.

  


Despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.

  


Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other IP rights. Third parties have asserted, are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In certain instances, we indemnify our end-customers, distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the IP of third parties.

  


Government Regulation

  


We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, regional, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, product labeling, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, data privacy laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. Many of the laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to our business are changing or being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the industry in which we operate. We believe we take reasonable steps designed to ensure we are in compliance with current laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently expect compliance to have a material adverse effect.

Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products.

  


Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, market consolidation, supply chain constraints, price list or discount changes or inflation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance, are better marketed, or achieve greater market acceptance than our products. Additionally, our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers, and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.

  


Human Capital Management 

  


As of December 31, 2022, our total headcount was 12,595 employees, approximately 30% of whom were employed in the United States and approximately 70% of whom were employed outside of the United States. 

  


Our employees are the foundation of our innovation and cybersecurity leadership for the benefit of our customers. We understand there is a shortage of highly skilled employees for security companies like ours, and we believe that our success and competitive advantage depends largely on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits, and we encourage a culture of fairness and meritocracy. Our compensation programs for our employees include base pay, incentive compensation, opportunities for equity ownership where local statutes allow and employee benefits that promote well-being across different aspects of our employees’ lives, which may include health and welfare insurance, retirement benefits and paid time off.

As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”). Such commitment starts at the top, with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 25% of the members of our board of directors, and approximately 50% of our board of directors was from underrepresented communities. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on enhancing our DEI initiatives across our workforce. 

  


We are also committed to community engagement and social responsibility with regards to our employees and beyond, and our board of directors has active oversight of such initiatives. Examples of our initiatives focused on our employees include our company matching program for employee charitable contributions and the free security training programs we offer to help with career development for our employees, in addition to the general public.

  


Our culture is defined by our commitment to ethics and integrity. We reinforce our ethical “tone at the top” through clear policies including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, regular compliance training for our employees, quarterly meetings of our cross-functional Ethics Committee, clear messaging from our executives, enforcement of company policies and oversight by our board of directors. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer regularly communicates the importance of Fortinet’s core values of openness, teamwork and innovation. 

  


We are committed to providing our employees a safe and healthy work environment. We sponsor a global wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial and mental wellbeing for all our employees around the world. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through communications, educational sessions, wellness challenges and other incentives.

  


None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in certain European and Latin American countries, however, have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain up-to-date union membership. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

  


Environmental, Social and Governance

  


We are committed to responsible environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. This commitment starts with the Social Responsibility Committee of our board of directors providing oversight of our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) strategy, initiatives and execution related to ESG matters. Our senior leadership sponsors the integration of CSR priorities throughout our business operations. In addition, our Global Head of Sustainability and CSR, along with our internal cross-functional employee CSR Committee, engage with internal and external stakeholders to lead CSR execution, communications and disclosure.

  


Environmental. We recognize that environmental considerations such as climate change, resource scarcity and the energy crisis are top priorities for the future of our planet. We are committed to helping address climate change impacts and minimizing the environmental footprint of our solutions, operations and our broader value chain. We have engaged with a consultancy to measure our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and to further engage on our path to carbon neutrality in alignment with the Paris Agreement we formally signed on to the Science-Based Target Initiative commitment in September 2022. We implemented an Environmental Management Systems platform to track our energy, water and waste impact, and engaged on the ISO14001 certification process for our company-owned warehouse in Union City, California. We began aligning our climate strategy and disclosures to the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures framework and submitted our Carbon Disclosure Project report. We continue to combine innovation with environmental sustainability to reduce the use of energy, cooling and space required for our solutions, thereby helping our customers minimize power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

  


Social. We are committed to building an inclusive, equitable and diverse workforce within our organization and across the security industry to help empower individuals to reach their full potential. We continue to focus on skilling, upskilling and reskilling individuals to reach our goal of training one million people in cybersecurity by 2026. At the 2022 White House National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit, we announced the expansion of our existing free training offerings, focusing on schools. We introduced an enhanced enterprise-grade Security Awareness and Training service to help Information Technology (“IT”), security and compliance leaders build a cyber-aware culture within their organizations. We continued to expand partnerships with educational institutions and now count over 500 Authorized Academic Partners. Our Education Outreach Program focuses on creating cyber career pathways for underrepresented populations, including women, veterans and disadvantaged individuals. In total, we trained over 210,000 people through our various initiatives in 2022. Internally, we pursue our progress on DEI and have established organizational governance by forming a global DEI Organizing Committee and DEI Council to provide a shared direction and commitment to recruiting and valuing a diverse workforce, fostering a culture of teamwork and openness, and building a more inclusive workplace.

Governance. Our approach to responsible business is based on strong corporate governance practices that aim to ensure accountability while meeting our responsibilities across our value chain. Our board of directors frequently reviews our governance practices to ensure that they are appropriate and reflect our company’s maturity. To promote ethical business practices, we have adopted policies related to proper business conduct and ethics that apply to employees, partners and suppliers, and we have compliance trainings and controls in place. In 2022, we expanded the human rights language in our compliance and business ethics training and updated our supplier and partner codes of conduct to reference our environmental and human rights policies. As part of our engagement with stockholders and our commitment to ESG, we regularly evaluate our corporate governance structure and practices, and have implemented the following measures, among others: majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors, allowing stockholders to call special meetings of our stockholders, declassification of our board of directors, proxy access and stock ownership guidelines with respect to our non-employee directors.
