ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves risks. In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” investors should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

•

Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.

Risks Related to the Company

We have a history of net losses and our future profitability is uncertain.

We have recorded a loss for fiscal year 2022 and our future profitability is uncertain. At December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit was $298.6 million. Since our inception, we have been engaged primarily in research and development and early-stage commercial activities. Because we have a limited history of commercial operations and operate in a rapidly evolving industry, we cannot be certain that we will generate sufficient revenue to operate our business and become profitable.

Our ability to generate revenues in the near-term is highly dependent on the successful commercialization of our biopolymer products, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties as described below. We expect that it will take time for our PHA production to ramp up to an economical scale while the market for our products expands. As a result, we may have significant losses and negative cash flow for at least the next few years, as we incur costs and expenses for the continued development and expansion of our business, including the costs of establishing manufacturing capacity and ongoing expenses of research and product development. The amounts we spend will impact our ability to become profitable and this spending will depend, in part, on the number of new products that we attempt to develop. We may not succeed with any or all of these products and, thus, we cannot provide assurances that we will ever be profitable.

Even if we can successfully manufacture and sell our products, whether we will be able to generate a profit on any of these products is highly uncertain and depends on a number of factors including the cost of production, the prices we are able to charge for these products, and the emergence of competing products.

Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.

We are subject to, among other things, the following factors that may negatively affect our operating results:

•

our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers;

•

the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;

•

the availability and cost of our raw materials;

•

changes in market conditions and other inputs that affect the valuation of our outstanding warrants;

•

the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors;

•

our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth;

•

stock-based compensation expenses we have incurred and may continue to incur in connection with the compensation of our executives and key personnel;

•

our ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost-effective manner;

•

technical difficulties;

•

our ability to identify and enter into relationships with appropriate and qualified third-party providers of necessary testing and manufacturing services;

•

regulation by federal, state or local governments; and

•

general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions specific to the plastics industry, and other industries related to compostable or biodegradable substitutes for non-biodegradable plastics.

* * *

As a result of our limited operating history and the nature of the markets in which we compete, it is difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. We have based our anticipated future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels will, to a large extent, become fixed. As a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain decisions concerning expenditures, pricing, service or marketing that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast.

We will need to secure additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all.

We will need to raise additional capital to continue to scale and expand our manufacturing capability. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, (i) we will incur fees associated with such issuance, (ii) our existing stockholders will experience dilution from the issuance of new equity securities, (iii) we will incur ongoing interest expense and may be required to grant a security interest in our assets in connection with any debt issuance, and (iv) any new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit income tax carryforwards may be subject to significant annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) due to ownership changes resulting from future equity financing transactions. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies or to grant licenses on unfavorable terms. In the event we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to successfully implement our business plan, which would have a material and adverse impact on our business.

Our biopolymer products may not achieve market success.

Some prospective customers are currently evaluating and testing our products prior to making large-scale purchase decisions. The successful commercialization of our biopolymers is also dependent on our customers’ ability to commercialize the end-products that they make from our biopolymers, which may never gain market acceptance.

Market acceptance of our products will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including among others:

•

consumer acceptance of such products;

•

our ability to produce products of consistent quality that offer functionality comparable or superior to existing or new polymer products;

•

our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our products;

•

the speed at which potential customers qualify our biopolymers for use in their products;

•

the pricing of our products compared to competitive products, including petroleum-based plastics;

•

the strategic reaction of companies that market competitive products;

•

our reliance on third parties who support or control distribution channels; and

•

general market conditions.

Raw material pricing and availability may be impacted by factors out of our control.

Pricing and availability of raw materials for use in our businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general, domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, competition, and consumer demand. Drought, pestilence, severe weather or other “acts of God” may limit our ability to procure bio-based raw materials if crops are lost. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

10

* * *

We sell formulated resins that include raw materials, including PLA, purchased from third parties. Our first targeted Rinnovo polymer requires ethylene oxide, carbon monoxide and a proprietary catalyst as its primary raw materials. We currently source all of our PLA from two suppliers, NatureWorks LLC and Total Corbion PLA. Due to the high rate of growth in the biopolymer market, the demand for PLA and other raw materials used in our products may outpace supply, which could result in price increases and deficits in the supply necessary to meet customer demand. If we are unable to secure the required quantities of PLA and other raw materials, we may not be able to achieve our financial forecasts and fulfill customer demand.

We have limited experience producing PHA in large commercial quantities.

We have limited experience in producing large quantities of PHA. While we have succeeded in producing smaller amounts of PHA in our pilot plant for customer trials and testing purposes, we continue to scale up the production of PHA in a large commercial plant with a capacity sufficient to meet the anticipated needs of prospective customers. We may not be able to cost effectively produce PHA at a scale consistent with customer demand in a timely or economical manner, or that the quality of the commercial product will be acceptable on a consistent basis.

We may be unable to obtain certifications required by certain customers.

Many of our customers require biopolymer formulations to undergo biodegradability testing to address physical property deterioration in specific environmental conditions. Biodegradation certification is important for our customers to ensure those products can be effectively marketed and sold and meet customer demands on environmental protection. If our new PHA-based resins produced and sold out of the Kentucky Facility do not achieve the required certifications in a timely manner, we may experience a delay in going to market. Such a delay could result in us not achieving our financial forecasts and not fulfilling customer demand.

We may be unable to manage rapid growth effectively.

Any potential failure to manage growth effectively could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We anticipate that a period of significant expansion will be required to address potential growth and to handle licensing and research activities. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must establish appropriate and scalable operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our management may be unable to hire, train, retain and manage the necessary personnel or to identify, manage and exploit potential strategic relationships and market opportunities.

We may be delayed in or unable to procure necessary capital equipment.

While the equipment we use to produce PHA and our other products is currently widely available, we must rely on outside companies to continue to manufacture the equipment necessary to produce our products. If our suppliers of capital equipment are unable or unwilling to provide us with necessary capital equipment to manufacture our products or if we experience significant delays in obtaining the necessary manufacturing equipment, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our success will be influenced by the price of petroleum relative to the cost of bio-based feedstocks.

Our success may be influenced by the price of our products relative to petroleum-based polymers. The cost of petroleum-based polymers is in part based on the price of petroleum. To date, our PHA biopolymers have been primarily manufactured using canola oil, an agricultural feedstock. If the price of bio-based feedstocks increases and/or the price of petroleum decreases, our bio-based products may be less competitive relative to petroleum-based polymers. A material decrease in the cost of conventional petroleum-based polymers may require a reduction in the prices of our products for them to remain attractive in the marketplace and/or reduce the size of our addressable market.

Certain contracts granting exclusivity rights to customers may limit our ability to sell products in certain markets.

We have entered into certain agreements with customers that grant the exclusive right to purchase certain products from us and, in some cases, in certain fields and/or territories. For example, certain clam-shell food cases made with plastic we produce can only be sold to a single customer, certain stirrers and straw products can only be sold to certain end-users, and one customer has an exclusive right on bottles containing certain alcohol products. These exclusivity arrangements will be expiring between 2023 and 2026. These agreements could prevent us from selling products to certain prospective customers or entering certain markets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our potential revenues and our ability more generally to expand our customer base and product lines.

11

* * *

Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.

A few significant customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2022, we had two customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue and collectively accounted for 40% of our revenue, whereas, in 2021, we had two customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue and collectively accounted for approximately 35% of our revenue. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, a substantial reduction in their orders, their inability to perform under their contracts, and/or a significant deterioration in their financial condition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We may rely heavily on future collaborative partners.

We may enter into strategic partnerships with other companies to accomplish one or more of the following:

•

obtain capital, equipment and facilities;

•

obtain funding for research and development programs, product development programs, and commercialization activities;

•

obtain expertise in relevant markets;

•

obtain access to proprietary technologies;

•

obtain access to raw materials; and/or

•

obtain sales and marketing services or support.

We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining suitable partnerships. Failure to make or maintain these arrangements or a delay or failure in a collaborative partner’s performance under any such arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

We face and will face substantial competition.

We face and will face substantial competition from a variety of companies in the biodegradable, renewable resource-based plastic segment, as well as from companies in the conventional, non-biodegradable petroleum-based industry segment. Some of their products are suitable for use in a range of products at prices that may be lower than the prices of our product offerings. Many of these companies have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources than we have. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies, changes in customer requirements and changes in laws and regulations. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves, with existing or potential customers, or with other third parties. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors.

We may not be able to complete the proposed production capacity buildout at our Greenfield Facility.

In November 2021, we broke ground on our Greenfield Facility located in Bainbridge, Georgia. We have designed this plant to have the capacity to produce 62.5 million pounds of neat PHA to be blended with other purchased raw materials. The Greenfield Facility has an engineering cost estimate ranging from $515 million to $665 million. Through December 31, 2022, we have invested $171.1 million in the Greenfield Facility, excluding capitalized interest and internal labor. We have suspended construction of the Greenfield Facility and completion of the facility is contingent upon receiving additional financing. In the event we do not obtain additional financing, we may be unable to successfully complete the Greenfield Facility, which could have a material and adverse impact on that investment.

We may not be able to identify and build a Rinnovo facility.

On August 11, 2021, we acquired Danimer Catalytic Technologies (formerly Novomer, Inc.). Danimer Catalytic Technologies has proprietary technology to produce p(3HP), which is a type of PHA and is branded as Rinnovo. We plan to construct a commercial Rinnovo plant and, at scale, we anticipate the proposed Rinnovo facility could produce approximately 168 million pounds of p(3HP). We believe we can blend Rinnovo with Nodax and other raw materials to further increase the number of finished pounds of product we can produce. We currently anticipate spending between $140 million and $220 million on the Rinnovo facility. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to identify an acceptable site, construct the facility, incorporate Rinnovo into Nodax-based formulations or raise the financing needed to construct the Rinnovo facility.

12

* * *

We may not be able to identify additional facilities and assets or secure the funding necessary to acquire them.

We may need to identify other facilities and assets that would be beneficial to our production of PHA at the commercial scale or our growth in general. We cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in identifying such facilities and assets or, if we do, raise the financing needed to acquire them.

Climate change may impact the availability of our facilities and, in addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives.

Changing weather patterns and any increase in frequency of severe storms such as hurricanes and tornadoes could cause disruptions or the complete loss of our facilities. In addition, climate change concerns, and changes in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could also subject us, our suppliers, or our customers to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs, which could negatively impact business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We are subject to product liability claims that may not be covered by insurance and could require us to pay substantial sums.

As our business grows and expands into different markets, we will increasingly become subject to an inherent risk of, and adverse publicity associated with, product liability and other liability claims, whether or not such claims have merit. We have obtained product liability insurance coverage in amounts and scope that we believe to be commercially reasonable and adequate for our product mix. However, product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Even if such insurance is available, product liability or other claims may exceed our insurance coverage limits. A successful product liability claim that exceeds our insurance coverage limits could require us to pay substantial sums and could have a material adverse effect on us.

Changes in government regulations encouraging the use of biodegradable alternatives to plastic products may have an adverse effect on our business.

We anticipate future laws, regulations and policies designed to encourage or mandate the increased use of compostable and biodegradable alternatives to non-biodegradable plastics may help to create a key market for our products. Several countries and other political subdivisions of countries have enacted or are considering enacting such laws and regulations. Failure to implement these or similar laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations may delay or adversely affect the demand for our product candidates in the future.

Compliance costs related to environmental requirements could negatively impact our financial results.

We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations or could require modifications to our facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.

Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical, fermentation, polymer, and extraction businesses, any of which could injure our employees or other persons, damage our facilities or other properties, interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.

Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and polymer manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation, including explosions, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons, and severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, as well as environmental contamination. In addition, the occurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after any period of operational difficulties.

13

* * *

We may not be able to protect adequately our patents and other intellectual property assets, which could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce the value of our products, and litigation to protect our patents and intellectual property assets may be costly.

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for technologies and products we develop, to preserve trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that any patents or patent applications that we own, file or are able to obtain or license from third parties will afford any competitive advantages or will not be challenged or circumvented by third parties. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any of our potential products can be commercialized, any related patents may expire or may have only a brief remaining life span following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patents.

If we are not able to obtain patent coverage or defend the patent protection for our technologies, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing technologies, and we may not generate enough revenues from product sales to justify the cost of development of our technologies and to achieve or maintain profitability. The patents currently in the portfolio have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2040 and any patents resulting from pending patent applications are expected to have a duration that will expire between 2036 and 2042.

Our patent position involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future pending patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and claims allowed under any issued patent or future issued patent owned or licensed by us may not be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technologies. Moreover, we may be unable to protect certain of our intellectual property in the United States or in foreign countries. Foreign jurisdictions may not afford the same protections as U.S. law, and we cannot ensure that foreign patent applications will have the same scope as the U.S. patents. There will be many countries in which we will choose not to file or maintain patents because of the costs involved. Competitors may also design around our technology or develop competing technologies.

Additionally, any issued patents owned by or licensed to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. To the extent competitors or other third parties develop and market products or procedures that we believe infringe our patents and proprietary rights, we may be compelled to initiate lawsuits to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. Such litigation is typically expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome, and may involve opponents who have much more extensive financial resources than we do. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Third parties may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights and may prevent us from commercializing and selling our products.

There has been substantial litigation in the manufacturing industry with respect to the manufacture, use, and sale of new products. These lawsuits often involve claims relating to the validity of patents supporting the new products and/or the validity and alleged infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may be required to defend against challenges to the validity of our patents and against claims relating to the alleged infringement of patent or proprietary rights of third parties.

Litigation initiated by a third-party claiming patent invalidity or patent infringement could:

•

require us to incur substantial litigation expense, even if we are successful in the litigation;

•

require us to divert significant time and effort of our management;

•

result in the loss of our rights to develop, manufacture or market our products; and

•

require us to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties in order to license proprietary rights from third parties or to satisfy judgments or to settle actual or threatened litigation.

Although patent and intellectual property disputes within the biopolymer and chemical industries have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include the long-term payment of royalties. Furthermore, the required licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or increase our costs to market our products.

14

* * *

We rely in part on trade secrets to protect our technology, and our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could limit our ability to compete.

We rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology and proprietary information, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Litigating a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop similar knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed.

Our debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $288.4 million of consolidated debt. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including that it may:

•

require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other business activities;

•

adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs, liquidity and access to capital markets;

•

limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with less leverage and/or superior access to capital.

There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize revolving credit facilities. Furthermore, a default under one debt instrument itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, operating leases and other obligations, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy such obligations, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt, operating leases and other obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate and maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, or to pay our other obligations.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund these obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet these obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds sought from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any such obligations then due. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, if we are unable to service our operating lease payments for certain facilities in Bainbridge, Georgia and Winchester, Kentucky, which we lease pursuant to a sale-leaseback transaction that was entered into in 2018 with a commercial property REIT, we could lose the ability to occupy and operate those facilities.

15

* * *

We may incur more debt in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks of leverage, including the ability to service our indebtedness.

We may need to incur additional debt, including equipment loans, working capital lines of credit, senior notes and other long-term debt, in the future to complete acquisitions of facilities, equipment, machinery and other assets or capital projects or for working capital. Although the covenants contained in our current indebtedness instruments impose limits on our ability to incur new debt, these agreements may permit the incurrence of significant additional debt if we satisfy certain conditions, or such debt instruments may be amended in the future to do so. If we incur new debt, we could face risks related to being in a highly leveraged company, including our ability to service such indebtedness.

We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) program for funding our plant expansions.

We have entered into several arrangements under the NMTC program with various third-party financial institutions (“Investors”) to help fund various phases of plant expansions at our Bainbridge, Georgia, and Winchester, Kentucky locations. In connection with the NMTC transactions, we received proceeds that were restricted for use on approved capital expenditures and working capital needs at specific subsidiaries. The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Code. We are required to comply with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements. We have agreed to indemnify the Investors for any loss or recapture of the NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. The maximum potential amount of future payments under this indemnification could be up to the face amount of the related debt, net of certain leverage loans receivable in connection with the NMTC transactions, which amount totaled $31.4 million as of December 31, 2022. Our obligation to deliver tax benefits will be relieved in various stages from April 2026 through November 2029. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by an investor and our being required to indemnify such investor, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income will be subject to certain limitations as a result of the business combination, private placement and past transactions.

Certain of our deferred tax assets relate to federal and state net operating losses and credits. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of $226 million and $156 million, respectively. We had state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $223 million and $173 million, respectively. A portion of these net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, in general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”) to offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. A portion of our existing NOLs is subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes in 2014. In addition, we believe the Business Combination and the related private placement of our Class A common stock that we completed in connection therewith constitutes an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state law. A portion of our existing NOLs attributable to Legacy Danimer and its subsidiaries is also subject to the so called separate-return-limitation-year (“SRLY”) rules that may apply to consolidated tax groups.

Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal and state taxable income. We have incurred significant net losses in the past, and it is anticipated that we may continue to incur significant losses; therefore, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our NOL carryforwards, even to the extent they are not subject to limitation by Section 382 of the Code or the SRLY rules.

We face various risks related to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and similar public health crises, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic. Such risks include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers.

16

* * *

It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 and its variants could also further cause disruption in our supply chain; cause delay or limit the ability of other customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; and cause other unpredictable events. In addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 and its variants has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital.

We continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, suppliers and local communities) to responsibly address risks associated with COVID-19. Our management is focused on mitigating the impact of the pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across Danimer and could delay other value-added initiatives. We continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.

The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the ongoing impact on our business and results of operations, financial condition, expected cash flows and liquidity may vary in material ways depending on how the virus impacts activity levels in the United States and globally. For this reason, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments and numerous and evolving factors that are highly uncertain, vary by market and cannot be accurately predicted or quantified at this time, including the duration and spread of the outbreak; new information concerning its transmission and severity; government mandated restrictions and regulations; business and workforce disruptions; impact on demand for our products, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease; actions taken or that might be taken by governments, businesses or individuals to contain or reduce its repercussions and mitigate its economic implications; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates and recessionary pressures; decreased consumer spending levels; reduction or changes in customer demand for our products and services; our ability to manufacture, sell and provide our products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions, closed borders, operating restrictions imposed on our facilities or reduced ability of our employees to continue to work efficiently; increased operating costs (whether as a results of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs or otherwise); collectability of customer accounts; additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the dollar; and the general impact of the pandemic on our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors and other stakeholders. Additionally, customers might defer decision making, delay orders or seek to renegotiate or terminate existing agreements.

The continuing global pandemic may also result in delays in our ability to apply for and obtain further regulatory approval for our products in various jurisdictions.

The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation continues to evolve, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.

We depend on key personnel.

We depend greatly on our executive officers and other employees. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, which will require substantial additional funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find, attract and retain additional qualified employees, directors, and advisors having the skills necessary to operate, develop and grow our business. Our inability to hire qualified personnel, the loss of services of any of our executive officers, or the loss of services of other key employees, or advisors that may be hired in the future, may have a material and adverse effect on our business.

If we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, including security breaches, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We depend on information technology systems throughout Danimer to, among other functions, control our manufacturing processes, process orders and bill, collect and make payments, interact with customers and suppliers, manage inventory and otherwise conduct business. We also depend on these systems to respond to customer inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment and record and pay amounts due to vendors and other creditors. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers. As we upgrade or change systems, we may also experience interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality and other unforeseen material issues that could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail

17

* * *

to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

In addition, cyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations or harm our reputation. Our information technology systems are subject to potential disruptions, including significant network or power outages, cyberattacks, computer viruses, other malicious codes and/or unauthorized access attempts, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and comply with and implement data security measures, there can be no assurance that any controls and procedures that we have in place will be sufficient to protect us. Further, as cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modify or enhance our systems in the future. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cyber security. Any such disruptions to our information technology systems, breaches or compromises of data, and/or misappropriation of information could result in violation of privacy and other laws, litigation, fines, negative publicity, lost sales or business delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Government regulation of our business is extensive and regulatory approvals are uncertain, expensive and time-consuming.

Our research, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of most of our intended products are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad. The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. There can be no assurance that, even after such time and expenditures, we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the manufacturing or marketing of any products. Even if regulatory clearance is obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown safety issues or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on a product’s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.

Changes in sentiment regarding and laws and regulations relating to plastic products could reduce demand for our products and/or increase the cost of producing our products and have an adverse effect on our business.

Plastic products have recently faced increasingly negative public sentiment and scrutiny. In addition, foreign, state and local governments have increasingly proposed, or in some cases implemented, restrictions or bans on plastic-based products, including single-use plastics, plastic straws and utensils. Notwithstanding the fact that our bio-plastic products are intended to address many of the concerns regarding traditional petroleum-based plastics, increased regulation of, or prohibition on, the use of plastics generally, as well as negative public sentiment regarding such products, could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use such products or otherwise limit the use of these products, and could lead to a decrease in demand for the products we make or an increase in the cost of production of such products. Such a decrease in demand could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

We may be unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions.

There may be many challenges to integrating acquired businesses into our Company, including eliminating redundant operations, facilities and systems, coordinating management and personnel, retaining key employees, managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. We may not be able to meet these challenges.

Potential international business opportunities may expose us to additional risks.

A part of our growth strategy depends on expanding internationally. Although sales outside of the United States account for a lesser percentage of our total net sales, we expect to increase our level of business activity outside of the United States. Some countries that present potential good business opportunities also face political and economic instability and vulnerability to infrastructure and other disruptions. Seeking to expand our business internationally exposes us to additional risks, which include foreign exchange risks and currency fluctuations, as discussed more fully below, political and economic uncertainties, changes in local business conditions and national and international conflicts. We also face the potential risks arising from staffing, monitoring and managing international operations, including the risk such activities may divert our resources and management time. In addition, compliance with the laws, regulations and taxes of multiple international jurisdictions increases our cost of doing business.

Risks Related to our Common Stock

An active trading market for our Common Stock may not be available on a consistent basis to provide stockholders with adequate liquidity. Our stock price may be extremely volatile, and our stockholders could lose a significant part of their investment.

An active trading market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained on a consistent basis. The public trading price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:

•

reported progress of our business and technology development, relative to investor expectations;

•

changes in earnings estimates, investors’ perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts’ earnings estimates;

•

quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations;

•

general market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;

•

future issuance and/or sale of our common stock or preferred stock;

•

announcements by us, or our competitors, of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;

•

commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;

•

any major change in our board of directors or management;

•

changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;

•

announcements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation involving our intellectual property;

•

a lack of, limited, or negative industry or security analyst coverage;

•

developments in our industry and general economic conditions;

•

short-selling or similar activities by third parties; and

•

other factors described elsewhere in these “Risk Factors.”

As a result of these factors, our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at, or above, their purchase price. In addition, the stock prices of many technology companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Any negative change in the public’s perception of the prospects of industrial biotechnology or “clean technology” companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.

We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).

If the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our securityholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:

•

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;

•

a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of our common stock;

•

a limited amount of analyst coverage; and

19

* * *

•

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

If we do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.

If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on an investment in our securities. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.

Factors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;

•

changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;

•

success of competitors;

•

our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;

•

changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning Danimer or the biopolymer industry in general;

•

share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to ours;

•

our ability to market new and enhanced products and technologies on a timely basis;

•

changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;

•

our ability to meet compliance requirements;

•

commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;

•

changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;

•

the volume of our shares of common stock available for public sale;

•

any major change in our board of directors or management;

•

sales of substantial amounts of our shares of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and

•

general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.

Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. Stock markets in general, and NYSE in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to ours could depress our share price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.

We may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, or we may be subject to restructuring, impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.

Factors outside of our control may, at any time, arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in us reporting losses.

Even though these charges may be non-cash items and therefore not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.

The issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock.

20

* * *

We may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance our operations or fund acquisitions, or for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we have 11,844,644 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options to purchase common stock issued under Legacy Danimer’s stock incentive plans, which outstanding options were assumed by the Company in connection with the Business Combination, and the Company’s 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”), 2,209,288 shares of common stock underlying the unvested portion of outstanding restricted stock awards made under the 2020 Plan, 50,251 shares of common stock underlying the unvested portion of outstanding share-settled performance awards made under the 2020 Plan, 3,914,525 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of private warrants, 1,689,744 shares of common stock reserved for future grant or issuance under the 2020 Plan and 2,403,392 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the Company’s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 125,489 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding Legacy Danimer non-plan options that were assumed by the Company in connection with the Business Combination. In addition to the stock options granted under our equity plans, we awarded 972,222 and 1,710,947 stock options in 2022 and 2021, respectively, as well as 439,698 and 95,943 performance shares in 2022 and 2021, respectively, that have a cash settlement feature in the event there are not shares available under the 2020 Plan. In December 2021, we issued $240 million principal amount convertible notes (“Convertible Notes”). The initial conversion rate is 92.7085 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $10.79 per share of common stock. If the Convertible Notes were to be converted into common stock in their entirety using the initial conversion rate, we would issue an additional 22,250,040 shares of common stock. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock may significantly decline. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.

The capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.

In connection with our issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions. The capped call transactions are generally intended to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.

In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Convertible Notes, any repurchase of the Convertible Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the Convertible Notes are retired by us, in each case if we exercise the relevant election to terminate the corresponding portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock that convertible noteholders receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.

The direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock, if any, is uncertain and any of such effects could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

The loss of certain key personnel could negatively impact the operations and financial results of our business.

Our ability to successfully operate our business is dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel of ours and there can be no assurance that they will be able to do so. It is possible that we will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact our operations and profitability.

We may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred shares under an employee incentive plan which would dilute the interest of our stockholders.

21

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in each case, par value $0.0001 per share. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock under an employee incentive plan. The issuance of additional common stock or preferred shares:

•

may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if one or more classes of preferred stock are created, and such preferred shares are issued, with rights senior to those afforded to common stock; and

•

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors.

Our Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the courts of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.

Our Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought in the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that this choice of forum does not apply to any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Finally, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

In March 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court issued a decision in Salzburg et al. v. Sciabacucchi, which found that an exclusive forum provision providing for claims under the Securities Act to be brought in federal court is facially valid under Delaware law. It is unclear whether this decision will be appealed, or what the final outcome of this case will be. We intend to enforce this provision, but we do not know whether courts in other jurisdictions will agree with this decision or enforce it.

This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock and/or spur litigation or regulatory action.

Short selling is the practice of selling securities that a seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. Short sellers hope to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement securities, as short sellers expect to pay less in that purchase than they received in the sale. As it is in short sellers’ interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions and allegations regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.

We have been the subject of negative publicity campaigns based on incomplete, outdated or misunderstood information. We do not believe there is any merit to these campaigns and we believe that their sole purpose was to benefit the short sellers of our securities. Furthermore, we believe that our responses to such campaigns, together with the substantial amount of publicly available information about us, sufficiently demonstrate the lack of merit of each claim. It is not clear what long-term effect such negative publicity could have on us and/or whether we will continue to be subject to short seller attacks from time to time in the future. If we were to become the subject of any additional unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would prefer to strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short sellers by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation

22

* * *

could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact the market price of our common stock and our business operations.

We believe that the several previously disclosed class action securities claims, the first of which was filed against us on May 14, 2021, are a result of these short seller reports. On May 5, 2021, we received a letter from the Atlanta regional office of the SEC, in connection with a non-public, fact-finding inquiry, requesting that we voluntarily produce certain specified information, to which we timely and voluntarily produced the requested information on July 14, 2021. Subsequently, the SEC had additional follow-up requests for further information, and we have timely and voluntarily responded to all such requests.
