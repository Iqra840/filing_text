ITEM 1\. BUSINESS

General Development of Business

Conagra Brands, Inc. (the "Company", "Conagra Brands", "we", "us", or "our"), headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Birds Eye®, Duncan Hines®, Healthy Choice®, Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, and Slim Jim®, as well as emerging brands, including Angie's® BOOMCHICKAPOP®, Duke's®, Earth Balance®, Gardein®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion.

We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1976. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories, including through acquisitions. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital.

General

The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments.

Conagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, most of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as global economic conditions, trade barriers or restrictions, supply chain disruptions, supply and demand, weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.

We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, product innovation, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.

Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. For example, sales of frozen foods tend to be marginally higher during the winter months, seafood sales are highest during Lent, in advance of the Easter holiday, and production of certain of our products occurs seasonally, during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural crops.

Our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, licensing agreements, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights are of material importance to our business, and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws, as well as entering into licensing, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others, including under the P.F. Chang’s®, Bertolli®, and Libby’s® trademarks. We also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third parties, such as the Alexia® trademark. While many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature, others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, local, and foreign government agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Labor. In particular, the processing, packaging, transportation, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation. Additionally, we are subject to data privacy and security regulations, tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.

Our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 28%, 27%, and 26% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Human Capital Resources 

At Conagra, we believe that our employees are the driving force behind our success. We believe that the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We leverage our six timeless values, which form the framework of our Company culture, to guide our approach to human capital management:

  

•

  

Integrity: Do the right things and do things right  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

External Focus: Center on the consumer, customer, competitor, and investor  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

Broad-Mindedness: Seek out and respect varied perspectives; embrace collaboration and assume positive intent  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

Agility: Convert insights into action with the speed of an entrepreneur  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

Leadership: Simplify, make decisions, inspire others, and act like an owner  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

Results: Leverage a "refuse-to-lose" obsession with impact and value creation  
  
--- --- ---  
  
We have developed key recruitment, development, and retention strategies and objectives that guide our human capital management approach. These strategies and objectives are advanced through a number of programs, policies, and initiatives, as described below.

As of May 28, 2023, we had approximately 18,600 employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 46% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.

* * *
Safety and Health: The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. We are focused on maintaining a strong culture of safety, in which all employees strive to protect themselves and their colleagues. During fiscal year 2023, our Occupational Safety & Health Administration Incident Rate was 1.58 incidents per 100 full-time workers, as compared to 1.67 incidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2022 and 2.00 incidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2021. We compare our incident rate to that of the average for companies in the food manufacturing sector, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In each of the last three fiscal years, our incident rate has been below the industry average. Our health and safety team audits each of our facilities every three years to confirm compliance with safety regulations and corporate policies. The team documents the audit results and tracks corrective actions to completion to confirm we hold ourselves accountable for providing a safe work environment.

Diversity and Inclusion: We nourish our inclusive culture by encouraging openness, acceptance, and individual authenticity. We believe that a diverse team gives us a competitive advantage and are committed to incorporating different ways of thinking, backgrounds, experiences, opinions, and viewpoints into our workforce to energize our culture and drive our success.

We believe diversity is measured by more than age, race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. All backgrounds, perspectives, styles, and opinions are valued and belong at Conagra. We harness the power of diversity and inclusion ("D&I") to accelerate innovation and growth and as key drivers of shareholder value creation.

Our commitment to D&I is exemplified by our Board of Directors (the "Board") with ages ranging from 51 to 71, diverse backgrounds and life experiences, three racially/ethnically diverse directors and four women directors serving on our ten-person board. The Human Resources Committee of our Board (the "HR Committee") oversees our D&I strategy. The HR Committee has embedded its oversight of our diversity and inclusion strategy into its standing agenda and receives regular updates from management on our diversity and inclusion goals and initiatives. We have set D&I goals that were embedded by our HR Committee into our executive compensation program for fiscal 2023 in the individual performance modifier for senior leaders under our annual incentive plan.

Our Senior Leadership Team is responsible for setting and driving our D&I strategy. During fiscal 2023, we launched numerous efforts to amplify our commitment to D&I through our D&I Leadership Council, comprised of senior leaders with a continued focus on driving accountability towards operationalizing our three strategic D&I pillars of recruitment, advocacy and development. Core aspects of our strategy include building a strong entry-level pipeline; developing programs to internally and externally advance our talent; and designing education and awareness programs that strengthen our culture of inclusion. Examples of recruitment, advocacy, and development initiatives launched during fiscal 2023 include the following:

We expanded our employee resource groups with the launch of our Disability+ Ally employee resource group.

Our goal is to create a culture of belonging, where everyone can experience inclusion. We want to be a place where people trust and respect one another. While we value and embrace diversity, we also celebrate what we all have in common—our energy and passion for making great food and great brands.

Learning and Development: We believe that by enabling employee growth and development, we better position Conagra to meet current and future business needs while driving employee retention. By providing employees with growth opportunities, we empower them to build knowledge and skills and make an impact through their work at Conagra.

We leverage a variety of tools and processes to promote a culture of employee learning and development at Conagra:

  

•

  

Job profiles are aligned to a Conagra-specific skills framework that defines and prioritizes the top skills desired for each role. Employees’ skills are assessed against the framework and the data is leveraged to provide tailored learning opportunities for each employee as well as drive programs to enhance organizational capabilities  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

Employees have access to numerous development opportunities including functional development programs, on-demand learning content, and targeted leadership programs. Our cross-functional opportunity marketplace allows employees to become involved in initiatives beyond their day-to-day job responsibilities, providing on-the-job learning  
  
--- --- ---  
  
  

•

  

We promote a learning culture through multiple levers such as expecting leaders to consistently coach, teach and mentor colleagues across the organization and our “Invest in You” program that encourages employees to set aside at least one-hour per workweek focused on learning  
  
--- --- ---  
  
Talent Acquisition: We believe Conagra offers one of the best cultures in the food industry along with numerous components for a long and prosperous career. Our Conagra Promise is to provide every employee with tools and programs to help them reach their full potential.

While the current labor market presents significant challenges for employers, Conagra has made differential investments in our Talent Acquisition tools and programs to help us continue to attract the right candidates.

  •   

Implemented new technology that enhances our marketing efforts while also simplifying the application process for prospective candidates

  •   

Continue to leverage data and key metrics to drive priorities and strategically focus recruiting efforts and resources across the enterprise  
  
--- --- ---  
  
Compensation and Benefits: We offer competitive compensation and benefits to attract the best talent and to support the overall well-being of our employees. Through our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees with resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, family care resources, a 401(k) plan, family leave, and paid time off.
