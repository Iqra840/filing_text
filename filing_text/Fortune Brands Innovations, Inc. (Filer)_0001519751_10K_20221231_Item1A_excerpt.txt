Item 1A. Risk Factors.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Industry Risks

Our business primarily relies on North American and Chinese home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels, all of which are impacted by risks associated with fluctuations in the housing market. Downward changes in the general economy, the housing market, unfavorable interest rates or other business conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our business primarily relies on home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels, principally in North America and China. The housing market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, access to and the cost of labor, consumer confidence, demographic changes, consumer income, government tax programs, availability of financing, inflation and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in any of the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and could adversely impact our businesses by: causing consumers to delay or decrease home ownership; making consumers more price conscious, resulting in a shift in demand to smaller, less expensive homes; making consumers more reluctant to make investments in their existing homes or causing them to delay investments, including kitchen and bath repair and remodel projects; or making it more difficult to secure loans for major renovations. Due to heightened inflation and increases in interest rates during 2022, the pace of single-family and existing home sales activity and new home construction and repair and remodel activities has slowed, which adversely impacted our results, and it is uncertain when such activities will recover.

We operate in very competitive consumer and trade brand categories.

The markets in which we operate are very competitive. Although we believe that competition in our businesses is based largely on product quality, consumer and trade brand reputation, customer service and product features, as well as fashion trends, innovation and ease of installation, price is a significant factor for consumers as well as our trade customers. Some of our competitors may resort to price competition to sustain or grow market share and manufacturing capacity utilization. Also, certain large customers continue to offer private-label brands that compete with some of our product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. The strong competition that we face in all of our businesses may adversely affect our profitability and revenue levels, as well as our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We may not successfully execute on our strategic plans, and our strategies may not prove effective in the face of business competition or yield the intended results.

The success of our business and business strategies depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. We may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products or processes more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

In connection with the Separation, we shifted from a decentralized structure with separate businesses to a more aligned operating model that prioritizes activities that are core to brand, innovation, and channel, among other changes. Although we believe that this transition allows us to fully leverage the scale and execution excellence of our total business, such transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and may result in a diversion of management’s focus and attention from other aspects of our business. In addition, our new operating model may not yield the intended results, and may have unexpected consequences, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations and make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategic plans.

Our businesses rely on the performance of wholesale distributors and dealers, retailers and other marketing arrangements and could be adversely affected by poor performance or other disruptions in our distribution channels and customers.

We rely on a distribution network comprised of consolidating customers. Any disruption to the existing distribution channels could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The consolidation of distributors or retailers or the financial instability or default of a distributor or one of its major customers could potentially cause such a disruption. In addition to our own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives and retailers. Certain of our distributors, representatives or retailers may also market other products that compete with our products. In addition, one or more retailers may stop carrying certain of our products, reduce the volume of purchases of our products and/or replace certain of our products with the products of our competitors. The loss or termination of, or significant reduction in sales to, one or more of our major distributors, representatives or retailers, the failure of one or more of our distributors, representatives or retailers to effectively promote our products, or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors, representatives or retailers could adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Operational and Sourcing Risks

Risks associated with our ability to improve organizational productivity and global supply chain efficiency and flexibility could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, supply or distribution difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We acquire our components and raw materials from many suppliers and vendors in various countries. We endeavor to ensure the continuity of our components and materials and make efforts to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, but we cannot guarantee these efforts will be successful. A reduction or interruption in supply or an issue in the supply chain, including as a result of our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell our products in a timely or cost-effective manner.

We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and global supply chains and assess opportunities to increase capacity, reduce costs and enhance quality. We may be unable to enhance quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage continued cost inflation, including wages, pension and medical costs. Our success depends in part on refining our cost structure and supply chains to promote consistently flexible and low-cost supply chains that can respond to market changes to protect profitability and cash flow or ramp up quickly and effectively to meet demand. Supply chain disruptions could continue to impact our ability to timely source necessary components and inputs. Import tariffs could potentially lead to increases in prices of raw materials or components which are critical to our business. Failure to achieve the desired level of quality, capacity or cost reductions could impair our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with global commodity and energy availability and price volatility, as well as the possibility of sustained inflation, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are exposed to risks associated with global commodity price volatility arising from restricted or uneven supply conditions, the sustained expansion and volatility of demand from emerging markets, potentially unstable geopolitical and economic variables, severe weather and other unpredictable external factors.

10

* * *

We buy raw materials that contain commodities such as wood, petroleum-based products such as resins, brass, zinc, steel, aluminum and glass. In addition, our distribution costs are significantly impacted by the price of oil and diesel fuel. Decreased availability and increased or volatile prices for these commodities, as well as energy used in making, distributing and transporting our products, could increase the costs of our products. We have been and may continue to be impacted by near-term supply, labor and freight constraints, a volatile global supply chain environment, as well as sustained increased rates of inflation, rising interest rates, unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and ongoing tariffs, all of which have increased our costs. While in the past we have been able to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through productivity improvements and passing on increasing costs to our customers over time, there is no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future, and the risk of potentially sustained high levels of inflation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we may use derivative contracts to limit our short-term exposure to commodity price volatility, the commodity exposures under these contracts could still be material to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, in periods of declining commodity prices, these derivative contracts may have the short-term effect of increasing our expenditures for these raw materials.

We may experience delays or outages in our information technology systems and computer networks. We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation and consumer relationships. Such breaches could subject us to significant financial, legal and operational consequences.

We, like most companies, may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. We rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure, including support provided by third parties, to support our business, our products and our customers. Our businesses may implement digital systems or technologies, enterprise resource planning systems or add applications to replace outdated systems and to operate more efficiently. We may not be able to successfully implement these projects without experiencing difficulties. Any expected benefits of implementing projects might not be realized or the costs of implementation might outweigh the benefits realized.

We routinely rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters, as well as information technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection, use, storage and transfer and other processing of data including confidential, business, financial, and personal information. Security threats, including cyber and other attacks, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. In addition, a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which (among other things) could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technology systems. Third-party systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. We believe we devote appropriate resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected data could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We manufacture, source and sell products internationally and are exposed to risks associated with doing business globally, including risks associated with uncertain trade environments.

We manufacture, source or sell our products in a number of locations throughout the world, predominantly in the U.S., Asia, Canada, Europe, Mexico and Africa. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with potential disruption caused by changes in political, economic and social environments, including war, civil and political unrest, illnesses declared as a public health emergency (including viral pandemics such as COVID-19), terrorism, expropriation, local labor conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments and trade disputes with the U.S., and U.S. laws affecting activities of U.S. companies abroad. We could be adversely affected by higher manufacturing costs and international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. Risks inherent to

11

* * *

international operations include: potentially adverse tax laws; unfavorable changes or uncertainty relating to trade agreements or importation duties; uncertainty regarding clearance and enforcement of intellectual property rights; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws; mandatory or voluntary shutdowns of our facilities or our suppliers due to changes in political dynamics that could result in longer lead times, economic policies or health emergencies and difficulty enforcing contracts. While we hedge certain foreign currency transactions, a change in the value of the currencies will impact our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, fluctuations in currency can adversely impact the cost position of our products in local currency, making it more difficult for us to compete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our businesses through the impact of these potential changes.

Disruption of operations could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in our manufacturing operations, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, continued labor shortages, transportation-related shortages, supply chain constraints, COVID-19, weather conditions (including due to the impacts of climate change, particularly for those facilities near any shorelines or in any other area traditionally impacted by extreme weather), lack of raw material or component availability, startup inefficiencies for new operations, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disasters, fires and explosions, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could negatively impact our profitability and competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.

We purchase raw materials to be used in manufacturing our products and also rely on third-party manufacturers to produce certain of the finished goods we sell. We often do not enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners. Instead, most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis. In addition, in some instances, we maintain single-source or limited-source sourcing relationships, either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. Financial, operating or other difficulties encountered by our suppliers or sourcing partners or changes in our relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies, and prevent us from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand. If we are unable to meet customer demand, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with strategic acquisitions and joint ventures could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We consider acquisitions and joint ventures as a means of enhancing stockholder value. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired companies and operating joint ventures; difficulties retaining the acquired businesses’ customers; the inability to achieve the expected financial results and benefits of transactions; the loss of key employees from acquired companies; implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, policies and information systems; and diversion of management’s attention from other business and strategic matters. Future acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt or issue additional shares, resulting in dilution in earnings per share and return on capital.

Impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated for impairment by management at least annually. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Future events may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets and require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not

limited to, lower than forecasted revenues, actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below our assumptions, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower levels of discretionary consumer spending, a decrease in royalty rates and a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Accordingly, we may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future.

Our pension costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets and changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.

Increases in the costs of pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of: the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension plan assets; potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations; and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension plan assets assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Our accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly due to the change in the fair value of pension assets and interest rates. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.

Legal, Regulatory and People Risks

COVID-19 has impacted our business and may cause further disruptions to our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on many aspects of the Company’s business and operations and may continue to impact the Company in the future, including impacting our ability to efficiently operate our facilities across the globe, the ability of our suppliers to supply and manufacture key inputs, availability and cost of transportation and logistics, customer behaviors, our employees, the distributors, dealers and retailers who sell our products, and the market generally. Our business could be negatively impacted over the longer term if the disruptions related to COVID-19 decrease consumer confidence and housing investments, or precipitate a prolonged economic downturn and/or an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth, any of which could lower demand for our products. The COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate certain of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in and may continue to result in operational challenges in the manufacturing of our products and the operation of the related domestic and international supply chains supporting our ability to manufacture our products and distribute them through our channels. Restrictions on or disruptions of transportation or increased border controls or closures, or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels, have in the past and could in the future increase our raw materials and commodity costs, increase demand for raw materials and commodities from competing purchasers, limit our ability to manufacture and distribute products to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and other labor constraints could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including our senior management team and other key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience, contacts and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and administration.

13

* * *

Low unemployment rates in the U.S., rising wages, competition for qualified talent and attracting and retaining personnel in remote locations could result in the failure to attract, motivate and retain personnel. This has resulted in higher employee costs, increased attrition and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations, and we may continue to face challenges in finding and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the production level, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Concerns over the long-term effects of climate change have led to, and we expect will continue to lead to, governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those effects. The Company will need to respond to any new laws and regulations as well as to consumer, investor and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns, which may increase our operational complexity and result in costs to us in order to comply with any new laws, regulations or preferences. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact international, regional and local economic activity, which may lower demand for our products or disrupt our manufacturing or distribution operations. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact on government regulation, consumer, investor and business preferences could have a long-term material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Environmental, social and governance matters may adversely impact our business and reputation.

In addition to the importance of their financial performance, companies are increasingly being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters.

In light of the increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet stakeholder expectations as to our proper role. Any failure or perceived failure by us in this regard could adversely impact our business and reputation.

In addition, developing and acting on ESG initiatives, including collecting, measuring and reporting related data, can be costly, difficult and time consuming. Significant expenditures and commitment of time by management, employees and outside advisors is involved in developing, implementing and overseeing policies, practices and internal controls related to ESG risk and performance, and we may undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics as the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand. Such costs may have an adverse impact our business and results of operations.

We also may face potential governmental enforcement actions or private litigation challenging our ESG and sustainability goals, or our disclosure of those goals and our metrics for measuring achievement of them, which may increase our costs of compliance.

Changes in government and industry regulatory standards could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Government regulations and policies pertaining to trade agreements, health and safety (including protection of employees as well as consumers), taxes and environment (including those specific to climate change and the reduction of air and energy emissions) may continue to emerge in the U.S., as well as internationally. In particular, there may be additional tariffs or taxes related to our imported raw materials, components and finished goods. It is necessary for us to comply with current requirements (including requirements that do not become effective until a future date), and even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our products or processes in the future. Compliance with changes in taxes, tariffs and other regulations may require us to further alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products; loss of market share; negative publicity; reputational damage; loss of customer confidence; or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) and could increase our capital expenditures and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

14

Future tax law changes or the interpretation of existing tax laws may materially impact our effective income tax rate, the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits and cash tax payments.

Our businesses are subject to taxation in the U.S., as well as internationally, including income tax, value-added tax and property tax. Our total tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which our businesses are subject to taxation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such laws by tax authorities which may have a material impact on our financial results. In addition, we are routinely audited by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Although we believe we record and accrue tax estimates that are reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on assumptions and require the exercise of significant judgment, and there are significant uncertainties in these estimates. As a result, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a material adverse effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in our financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement.

Our inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation.

We have many patents, trademarks, brand names, trade names and trade secrets that, in the aggregate, are important to our business. Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights or other loss of our intellectual property competitive position may not only erode sales of our products but also cause us to incur substantial significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with our ability to effectively represent the Company to our customers, contractors and suppliers, and increase litigation costs. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our brands and trademark rights will prevent violations. In addition, existing patent, trade secret and trademark laws offer only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect our intellectual property from infringement by others. There can be no assurance that our efforts to assess possible third-party intellectual property rights will ensure the Company’s ability to manufacture, distribute, market or sell in any given country or territory. Furthermore, others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers which may require us to incur significant expense to defend such litigation or indemnify our customers.

Potential liabilities and costs from claims and litigation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have an adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, intellectual property disputes, product recalls, personal injury claims, construction defects and home warranty claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters, and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions. It is not possible to predict the outcome of pending or future litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of the actions could be decided unfavorably and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly to defend. As a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

Risks Related to the Separation of MasterBrand

The Separation may not achieve some or all of the benefits anticipated, and, following the Separation, our stock price may underperform relative to our expectations.

By completing the Separation of MasterBrand, the Company created two independent, publicly traded companies with the resources to enhance the long-term growth and return prospects and offer substantially greater long-term value to the stockholders, customers and employees of each company. Although we believe that the Separation will provide financial, operational and other benefits to us and our stockholders, it may not provide such results on the scope or scale that we anticipate, and we may not realize the full strategic and financial benefits we expect. Failure to achieve these benefits could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and stock price. We are now a smaller and less diversified business than before the Separation, and accordingly certain business and operational risks may be amplified by the Separation.

In connection with the Separation, the Company and MasterBrand have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities. If we are required to indemnify MasterBrand, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Further, MasterBrand’s indemnities may not be sufficient to hold the Company harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which MasterBrand has been allocated responsibility, and MasterBrand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements between the Company and MasterBrand related to the Separation, each party has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that MasterBrand is required to provide to us are not subject to any cap and may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MasterBrand has agreed to retain. Any amounts that we may be required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. Further, the indemnities from MasterBrand for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and MasterBrand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations.

Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MasterBrand any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

If the Separation, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.

We received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS” and the “IRS Ruling”) and an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP (the “Sidley Opinion”), together, substantially to the effect that the spin-off and the Separation of MatserBrand will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (except for any stockholders that received cash in lieu of fractional shares of common stock).

Although a private letter ruling from the IRS is generally binding on the IRS, the IRS Ruling relied on certain facts, assumptions and representations from us and MasterBrand, including representations regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses. Moreover, the IRS Ruling is not a comprehensive ruling regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Separation. The Sidley Opinion also relied on certain facts, assumptions and representations, as described therein, as well as the continued validity of the IRS Ruling. The Sidley Opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with such opinion.

16

* * *

Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the Sidley Opinion, the IRS could determine that the Separation should be treated as taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, or representations is not correct or has been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the IRS Ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Separation. If the Separation ultimately is determined to be taxable, the Separation could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Company could recognize gains in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the MasterBrand common stock distributed to Fortune Brands' stockholders on the date of the Separation over Fortune Brands’ tax basis in such MasterBrand common stock. Furthermore, Fortune Brands could incur significant tax indemnification obligations under the Tax Allocation Agreement related to the Separation.
